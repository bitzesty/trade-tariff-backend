# Trade Tariff Backend

The API back-end for:

* [Trade Tariff Frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/trade-tariff-frontend)
* [Trade Tariff Admin](https://github.com/alphagov/trade-tariff-admin)

Also uses:

* [Trade Tariff Suite](https://github.com/alphagov/trade-tariff-suite)
* [Trade Tariff Oracle](https://github.com/alphagov/trade-tariff-oracle)

## Setup

### If using the GOV.UK development Vagrant VM

Ensure that you have pulled the latest version of the puppet repo.

Run the bootstrap command `govuk_puppet`.

### Dependencies (OS X using Homebrew)

1. ElasticSearch & MySQL & Redis

    ```
    brew install elasticsearch
    brew install redis
    brew install mysql
    ```

2. Ruby 2.0.0

    ```
    brew install chruby
    brew install ruby-install
    ```

## Load database

Check out [wiki article on the subject](https://github.com/alphagov/trade-tariff-backend/wiki/System-rebuild-procedure), or get a recent database snapshot.

### Load database seeds for development API user

  ```
  bundle exec rake db:seed
  ```

## Run Backend

  ```
  bundle exec ./startup.sh
  ```

## Performing daily updates

1. Create config/trade_tariff_backend_secrets.yml file with correct values.

  ```yaml
  sync_username:
  sync_password:
  sync_host:
  sync_email:
  ```

2. Run the sync rake task

  ```
  bundle exec rake tariff:sync:apply
  ```

### Sync process

- checking failures (check tariff_synchronizer.rb) - if any of updates failed in the past, sync process will not proceed
- downloading missing files up to Date.today (check base_update.rb and download methods in taric_update.rb and chief_update.rb)
- applying downloaded files (applying measures, etc. TARIC first, then CHIEF)

Applying downloaded CSV files is the most confusing and buggy part.
Updates are performed in portions and protected by redis lock (see TariffSynchronizer#apply).

BaseUpdate#apply is responsible for most of the logging/checking job and running
#import! methods located in Taric/ChiefUpdate classes. Then it runs TaricImporter
and ChiefImporter to parse and store xml/csv files.

Whole process is quite similar for both TARIC and CHIEF, but CHIEF updates also does
transformation process at the end. Check ChiefTransformer class for more info (and ChiefUpdate#import!).

In case of any errors, changes (per single update) are roll-backed and record itself is marked as failed.

### Manual Rollback

  Keep in mind that there are two ways of rolling-back, one with keeping the intermediary updates stored in db, and another one without.
  The default option is to remove TARIC/CHIEF updates and data transformations. 

  ```
  DATE='2014-01-30' bundle exec rake tariff:sync:rollback
  ```

## Development with Docker and Fig

### Fig / Docker setup

#### 1. Install docker and fig
   Check out [Install Guide](http://www.fig.sh/install.html)

#### 2. Build fig in app root.
   ##### NOTE: you also need to setup frontend and admin apps with docker before.
   * [Trade Tariff Frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/trade-tariff-frontend)
   * [Trade Tariff Admin](https://github.com/alphagov/trade-tariff-admin)

   ##### NOTE: can take some time to download and build some docker images

   ```
   fig build && fig up -d && sudo -E bash docker_ips.sh

   # NOTE: it's important to run 'sudo bash docker_ips.sh', because IPs of docker containers are dynamic
   # and will be changed anytime you run 'fig start' or 'fig up'
   ```

#### 3. Prepare database in api docker containers:
   ```
   fig run api bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate db:seed
   ```

#### 4. Now you can open in browser:
   ##### [API Root](http://tariff-api.dev.gov.uk:3018)
   ##### [FRONTEND Root](http://tariff.dev.gov.uk:3017)
   ##### [ADMIN Root](http://tariff-admin.dev.gov.uk:3046)

### Development via Docker / Fig

#### Deploy latest version of app to docker / fig container

   NOTE: it's important to pass '--no-recreate' option for 'fig up' command.
         By default 'fig up' will recreate all environment (including database)

   ```
   fig stop && fig up -d --no-recreate && sudo bash docker_ips.sh
   ```

#### Start / stop server

   ```
   fig stop
   fig start && sudo bash docker_ips.sh
   ```

#### Run db migrations / rake tasks

   ```
   fig run api bundle exec rake db:migrate
   ```

#### Rails console

   ```
   fig run api bundle exec rails console
   ```

#### View app logs

   ```
   fig logs api
   ```

#### Run Rspec tests

   ```
   fig run api bundle exec rake spec
   ```

#### SSH to docker app
 
   ```
   $ fig run api /bin/sh
   root@af8bae53bdd3:/#

   # when you're done you can use the exit command to finish.
   # root@af8bae53bdd3:/# exit
   ```


## Notes

* Project does __not__ contain schema.rb, do not use rake db:schema:load. Sequel
does not yet support view creation via schema file.

* When writing validators in `app/validators` please run the rake task
`audit:verify` which runs the validator against existing data.
