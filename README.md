* [Trade Tariff Frontend](https://github.com/bitzesty/trade-tariff-frontend)
* [Trade Tariff Admin](https://github.com/bitzesty/trade-tariff-admin)

## Development

### Dependencies

  - Ruby
  - Postgresql
  - ElasticSearch
  - Redis

### Setup

Please go through this updated [setup document](https://github.com/bitzesty/trade-tariff-backend/blob/master/SETUP.md)

1. Setup your environment.

    bin/setup

2. Update `.env` file with valid data. To enable the XI version, add the extra flag `SERVICE=xi`. If not added, it will default to the UK version.

3. Start Foreman.

    foreman start

4. Verify that the app is up and running.

    open http://localhost:3018/healthcheck

## Load database

Check out [wiki article on the subject](https://github.com/bitzesty/trade-tariff-backend/wiki/System-rebuild-procedure), or get a [recent database snapshot](mailto:support@bitzesty.com).

## Performing daily updates

These are run hourly by a background worker UpdatesSynchronizerWorker.

### Sync process

- checking failures (check tariff_synchronizer.rb) - if any of updates failed in the past, sync process will not proceed
- downloading missing files up to Date.today (check base_update.rb and download methods in taric_update.rb and chief_update.rb)
- applying downloaded files (applying measures, etc. TARIC first, then CHIEF)

Updates are performed in portions and protected by redis lock (see TariffSynchronizer#apply).

BaseUpdate#apply is responsible for most of the logging/checking job and running
`import!` methods located in Taric/ChiefUpdate classes. Then it runs TaricImporter
and ChiefImporter to parse and store xml/csv files.

Whole process is quite similar for both TARIC and CHIEF, but CHIEF updates undergo a tranformation
transformation process to convert them into a TARIC format. Check ChiefTransformer class for more info (and ChiefUpdate#import!).

In case of any errors, changes (per single update) are roll-backed and record itself is marked as failed. The sync would need to be rerun after a rollback.

## Deployment

We deploy to cloud foundry, so you need to have the CLI installed, and the following [cf plugin](https://github.com/bluemixgaragelondon/cf-blue-green-deploy) installed:


Set the following ENV variables:
* CF_USER
* CF_PASSWORD
* CF_ORG
* CF_SPACE
* CF_APP
* CF_APP_WORKER
* HEALTHCHECK_URL
* SLACK_CHANNEL
* SLACK_WEBHOOK

Then run

    ./bin/deploy

NB: In the newer Diego architecture from CloudFoundry, no-route skips creating and binding a route for the app, but does not specify which type of health check to perform. If your app does not listen on a port, for example the sidekiq worker, then it does not satisfy the port-based health check and Cloud Foundry marks it as crashed. To prevent this, disable the port-based health check with cf set-health-check APP_NAME none.

## Scaling the application

We are using CF [AutoScaler](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/app-autoscaler) plugin to perform application autoscaling. Set up guide and documentation are available by links below:

https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/managing_apps.html#autoscaling

https://github.com/cloudfoundry/app-autoscaler/blob/develop/docs/Readme.md



To check autoscaling history run:

    cf autoscaling-history APPNAME

To check autoscaling metrics run:

    cf autoscaling-metrics APP_NAME METRIC_NAME
 
To remove autoscaling policy and disable App Autoscaler run:

    cf detach-autoscaling-policy APP_NAME

To create or update autoscaling policy for your application run:

    cf attach-autoscaling-policy APP_NAME ./policy.json


Current autosscaling policy files are [here](https://github.com/bitzesty/trade-tariff-backend/blob/master/config/autoscale).

* When writing validators in `app/validators` please run the rake task
`audit:verify` which runs the validator against existing data.
