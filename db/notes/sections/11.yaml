  5902 and of a mixture of two or more textile materials are to be classified as if
  consisting wholly of that one textile material which predominates by weight over
  any other single textile material.\r\n* When no one textile material predominates
  by weight, the goods are to be classified as if consisting wholly of that one textile
  material which is covered by the heading which occurs last in numerical order among
  those which equally merit consideration.\r\n* (B) For the purposes of the above
  rule:\r\n  * (a) gimped horsehair yarn (heading 5110) and metallised yarn (heading
  5605) are to be treated as a single textile material the weight of which is to be
  taken as the aggregate of the weights of its components; for the classification
  of woven fabrics, metal thread is to be regarded as a textile material;\r\n  * (b)

  such materials are to be treated as a single textile material.\r\n* (C) The provisions
  of paragraphs (A) and (B) above apply also to the yarns referred to in note 3, 4,
  5 or 6 below.\r\n* 3\\. (A) For the purposes of this section, and subject to the
  exceptions in paragraph (B) below, yarns (single, multiple (folded) or cabled) of

  paragraph (B) below, yarn (single, multiple (folded) or cabled) put up:\r\n  * (a)
  on cards, reels, tubes or similar supports, of a weight (including support) not
  exceeding:\r\n    * (1) 85 g in the case of silk, waste silk or man-made filament

  (b) produced in the finished state, ready for use (or merely needing separation
  by cutting dividing threads) without sewing or other working (for example, certain
  dusters, towels, tablecloths, scarf squares, blankets);\r\n  * (c) cut to size and
  with at least one heat-sealed edge with a visibly tapered or compressed border and
  the other edges treated as described in any other sub-paragraph of this note, but
  excluding fabrics, the cut edges of which, have been prevented from unravelling
  by hot cutting or by other simple means;\r\n  * (d) hemmed or with rolled edges,
  or with a knotted fringe at any of the edges, but excluding fabrics, the cut edges

  of layers of parallel textile yarns superimposed on each other at acute or right
  angles. These layers are bonded at the intersections of the yarns by an adhesive
  or by thermal bonding.\r\n* 10\\. Elastic products consisting of textile materials
  combined with rubber threads are classified in this section.\r\n* 11. For the purposes
  of this section, the expression 'impregnated' includes 'dipped'.\r\n* 12\\. For

  13\\. For the purposes of this section and, where applicable, throughout the nomenclature,
  the expression 'elastomeric yarn' means filament yarn, including monofilament, of
  synthetic textile material, other than textured yarn, which does not break on being

  to twice its original length, within a period of five minutes, to a length not greater
  than one and a half times its original length.\r\n* 14\\. Unless the context otherwise
  requires, textile garments of different headings are to be classified in their own
  headings, even if put up in sets for retail sale. For the purposes of this note,
  the expression 'textile garments' means garments of headings 6101 to 6114 and headings
  6201 to 6211.\r\n\r\n## Subheading notes ##\r\n\r\n* 1\\. In this section and, where
  applicable, throughout the nomenclature, the following expressions have the meanings
  hereby assigned to them:\r\n  * (a) _'Unbleached yarn'_: \r\n  * yarn which:\r\n
  \   * (1) has the natural colour of its constituent fibres and has not been bleached,
  dyed (whether or not in the mass) or printed; or\r\n    * (2) is of indeterminate
  colour (grey yarn), manufactured from garnetted stock.\r\n  * Such yarn may have
  been treated with a colourless dressing or fugitive dye (which disappears after
  simple washing with soap) and, in the case of man-made fibres, treated in the mass
  with delustring agents (for example, titanium dioxide).\r\n  * (b) _'Bleached yarn'_:\r\n
  \ * yarn which:\r\n    * (1) has undergone a bleaching process, is made of bleached
  fibres or, unless the context otherwise requires, has been dyed white (whether or
  not in the mass) or treated with a white dressing;\r\n    * (2) consists of a mixture
  of unbleached and bleached fibres; or\r\n    * (3) is multiple (folded) or cabled
  and consists of unbleached and bleached yarns.\r\n  * (c) _'Coloured (dyed or printed)
  yarn'_:\r\n  * yarn which:\r\n    * (1) is dyed (whether or not in the mass) other
  than white or in a fugitive colour, or printed, or made from dyed or printed fibres;\r\n
  \   * (2) consists of a mixture of dyed fibres of different colours or of a mixture
  of unbleached or bleached fibres with coloured fibres (marl or mixture yarns), or
  is printed in one or more colours at intervals to give the impression of dots;\r\n
  \   * (3) is obtained from slivers or rovings which have been printed; or\r\n    *
  (4) is multiple (folded) or cabled and consists of unbleached or bleached yarn and
  coloured yarn.\r\n* The above definitions also apply, mutatis mutandis, to monofilament
  and to strip or the like of Chapter 54.\r\n  * (d) _'Unbleached woven fabric'_:\r\n
  \ * Woven fabric made from unbleached yarn and which has not been bleached, dyed
  or printed. Such fabric may have been treated with a colourless dressing or a fugitive
  dye.\r\n  * (e) _'Bleached woven fabric'_:\r\n  * Woven fabric which:\r\n    * (1)
  has been bleached or, unless the context otherwise requires, dyed white or treated
  with a white dressing, in the piece;\r\n    * (2) consists of bleached yarn; or\r\n
  \   * (3) consists of unbleached and bleached yarn.\r\n  * (f) _'Dyed woven fabric'_:\r\n
  \ * Woven fabric which:\r\n    * (1) is dyed a single uniform colour other than
  white (unless the context otherwise requires) or has been treated with a coloured
  finish other than white (unless the context otherwise requires), in the piece; or\r\n
  \   * (2) consists of coloured yarn of a single uniform colour.\r\n  * (g) _'Woven
  fabric of yarns of different colours'_:\r\n  * woven fabric (other than printed
  woven fabric) which:\r\n    * (1) consists of yarns of different colours or yarns
  of different shades of the same colour (other than the natural colour of the constituent
  fibres);\r\n    * (2) consists of unbleached or bleached yarn and coloured yarn;
  or\r\n    * (3) consists of marl or mixture yarns.\r\n* (In all cases, the yarn
  used in selvedges and piece ends is not taken into consideration).\r\n  * (h) _'Printed
  woven fabric'_:\r\n  * Woven fabric which has been printed in the piece, whether
  or not made from yarns of different colours.\r\n* (The following are also regarded
  as printed woven fabrics: woven fabrics bearing designs made, for example, with
  a brush or spray gun, by means of transfer paper, by flocking or by the batik process.)\r\n*
  The process of mercerisation does not affect the classification of yarns or fabrics
  within the above categories.\r\n* The definitions at (d) to (h) above apply, mutatis
  mutandis, to knitted or crocheted fabrics.\r\n  * (ij) _'Plain weave'_:\r\n  * a
  fabric construction in which each yarn of the weft passes alternately over and under
  successive yarns of the warp and each yarn of the warp passes alternately over and
  under successive yarns of the weft.\r\n* 2\\. (A) Products of Chapters 56 to 63
  containing two or more textile materials are to be regarded as consisting wholly
  of that textile material which would be selected under note 2 to this section for
  the classification of a product of Chapters 50 to 55 or of heading 5809 consisting
  of the same textile materials.\r\n* (B) For the application of this rule:\r\n  *
  (a) where appropriate, only the part which determines the classification under interpretative
  rule 3 shall be taken into account;\r\n  * (b) in the case of textile products consisting
  of a ground fabric and a pile or looped surface, no account shall be taken of the
  ground fabric;\r\n  * (c) in the case of embroidery of heading 5810 and goods thereof,
  only the ground fabric shall be taken into account. However, embroidery without
  visible ground and goods thereof, shall be classified with reference to the embroidering
  threads alone."
