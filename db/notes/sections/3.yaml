:content: "1. This chapter does not cover:\r\n\r\n(a) pig fat or poultry fat of heading
  0209;\r\n\r\n(b) cocoa butter, fat and oil (heading 1804);\r\n\r\n(c) edible preparations
  containing by weight more than 15 % of the products of heading 0405 (generally,
  Chapter 21);\r\n\r\n(d) greaves (heading 2301) or residues of headings 2304 to 2306;\r\n\r\n(e)
  fatty acids, prepared waxes, medicaments, paints, varnishes, soap, perfumery, cosmetic
  or toilet preparations, sulphonated oils or other goods of Section VI; or \r\n\r\n(f)
  factice derived from oils (heading 4002).\r\n\r\n2. Heading 1509 does not apply
  to oils obtained from olives by solvent extraction (heading 1510).\r\n\r\n3. Heading
  1518 does not cover fats or oils or their fractions, merely denatured, which are
  to be classified in the heading appropriate to the corresponding undenatured fats
  and oils and their fractions.\r\n\r\n4. Soap-stocks, oil foots and dregs, stearin
  pitch, glycerol pitch and wool grease residues fall in heading 1522.\r\n\r\nSubheading
  note\r\n\r\n1.For the purposes of subheadings 1514 11 and 1514 19, the expression
  ‘low-erucic-acid rape or colza oil’ means the fixed oil which has an erucic acid
  content of less than 2 % by weight.\r\n\r\nAdditional notes\r\n\r\n1. For the purposes
  of subheadings 1507 10, 1508 10, 1510 00 10, 1511 10, 1512 11, 1512 21, 1513 11,
  1513 21, 1514 11, 1514 91, 1515 11, 1515 21, 1515 50 11, 1515 50 19, 1515 90 21,
  1515 90 29, 1515 90 40 to 1515 90 59 and 1518 00 31:\r\n\r\n(a) fixed vegetable
  oils, fluid or solid, obtained by pressure, are to be considered as ‘crude’ if they
  have undergone no other processing than:\r\n\r\n— decantation within the normal
  time limits,\r\n\r\n— centrifugation or filtration, provided that, in order to separate
  the oils from their solid constituents, only mechanical force, such as gravity,
  pressure or centrifugal force, has been employed (excluding any adsorption filtering
  process or any other physical or chemical process);\r\n\r\n(b) fixed vegetable oils,
  fluid or solid, obtained by extraction are to continue to be considered as ‘crude’
  when they cannot be distinguished, by their colour, odour or taste, nor by recognised
  special analytical properties, from vegetable oils and fats obtained by pressure;\r\n\r\n(c)
  the expression ‘crude oils’ is to be taken to extend to degummed soya-bean oil and
  to cotton-seed oil from which the gossypol has been removed.\r\n\r\n2.A.\r\nHeadings
  1509 and 1510 cover only oils derived solely from the treatment of olives and having
  the characteristics, with regard to the content of fatty acids and sterols, which
  are referred to in Annex I to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2568/91 (1). Their
  presence can be determined using methods set out in Annexes V and X to that Regulation.\r\nHeadings
  1509 and 1510 do not cover chemically altered olive oil (in particular re-esterified
  olive oil) and mixtures of olive oil with other oils. The presence of re-esterified
  olive oil is ascertained using the method set out in Annex VII to Regulation (EEC)
  No 2568/91.\r\n\r\nB.Subheading 1509 10 covers only the olive oils defined in points
  1, 2 and 3 below, obtained solely by mechanical or other physical means under conditions
  which do not lead to the modification of the oil, and which have not undergone any
  treatment other than washing, decantation, centrifugation or filtration. Olive oils
  obtained using solvents, chemical or biochemical reagents, or re-esterification
  processes, as well as any mixtures with oils of other kinds, are excluded from this
  subheading.\r\n\r\nI. For the purposes of subheading 1509 10 10, ‘lampante olive
  oil’ means olive oil having the characteristics of olive oils of category 3 as set
  out in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2568/91.\r\n\r\nII. For the purposes of subheading
  1509 10 20, ‘extra virgin olive oil’ means olive oil having the characteristics
  of olive oils of category 1 as set out in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2568/91.\r\n\r\n*
  1\\. a content in volatile halogenated solvents not exceeding 0.2 mg/kg overall
  and not exceeding 0.1 mg/kg for each solvent;\r\n\r\n* 2\\. organoleptic characteristics
  showing a median of defects exceeding 3.5, in accordance with Annex XII to Commission
  Regulation (EEC) no 2568/91.\r\n\r\n* 3\\. Subheading 1509 10 80 covers other virgin
  olive oils which have the characteristics of olive oils of category 2 as set out
  in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2568/91.\r\n\r\nC. Subheading 1509 90 covers olive
  oil obtained by the treatment of olive oils of subheading 1509 10 10, 1509 10 20,
  and/or 1509 10 80, whether or not blended with virgin olive oil, and having the
  characteristics of olive oils of categories 4 and 5 as set out in Annex I to Regulation
  (EEC) No 2568/91.\r\n\r\nD. For the purposes of subheading 1510 00 10, ‘crude oils’
  means oils with the characteristics of olive oils of category 6 as set out in Annex
  I to Regulation (EEC) No 2568/91.\r\n\r\nE. Subheading 1510 00 90 covers oils obtained
  by the treatment of oils of subheading 1510 00 10, whether or not blended with virgin
  olive oil, and oils not having the characteristics of the oils referred to in points
  B, C and D of this additional note.\r\n\r\nOils of this subheading must have the
  characteristics of the olive oils of categories 7 and 8 as set out in Annex I to
  Regulation (EEC) No 2568/91.\r\n\r\n3 Subheadings 1522 00 31 and 1522 00 39 do not
  cover:\r\n\r\n(a) residues resulting from the treatment of fatty substances containing
  oil having an iodine index, determined in accordance with the method laid down in
  Annex XVI to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2568/91, lower than 70 or higher than
  100;\r\n\r\n(b) residues resulting from the treatment of fatty substances containing
  oil having an iodine index higher than 70 or lower than 100, of which the peak area
  representing the retention volume of betasitosterol (2), determined in accordance
  with Annex V to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2568/91, is less than 93,0 % of the
  total sterol peak areas.\r\n\r\n4.The analytical methods for the determination of
  the characteristics of the products referred to above are those laid down in the
  Annexes to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2568/91. Accordingly, account is to be
  taken also of the footnotes of Annex I to the Regulation.\r\n\r\n5.Food preparations
  made from products of Chapter 15 presented in measured doses, such as capsules,
  tablets, pastilles and pills, intended for use as food supplements, are excluded
  from this Chapter. The essential character of a food supplement is not only given
  by its ingredients, but also by its specific form or presentation revealing its
  function as a food supplement, since it determines the dosage, the way in which
  it is absorbed and the place where it is supposed to become active. Such food preparations
  are to be classified under heading 2106 insofar as they are not specified or included
  elsewhere."
