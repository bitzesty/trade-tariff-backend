  section, note 1 to Chapter 84 and to note 1 to Chapter 85, parts of machines (not
  being parts of the articles of heading 8484, 8544, 8545, 8546 or 8547) are to be
  classified according to the following rules:\r\n  * (a) Parts which are goods included
  in any of the headings of Chapter 84 or 85 (other than headings 8409, 8431, 8448,
  8466, 8473, 8487, 8503, 8522, 8529, 8538 and 8548) are in all cases to be classified
  in their respective headings.\r\n  * (b) Other parts, if suitable for use solely
  or principally with a particular kind of machine, or with a number of machines of
  the same heading (including a machine of heading 8479 or 8543) are to be classified
  with the machines of that kind or in heading 8409, 8431, 8448, 8466, 8473, 8503,
  8522, 8529 or 8538 as appropriate. However, parts which are equally suitable for
  use principally with the goods of headings 8517 and 8525 to 8528 are to be classified
  in heading 8517.\r\n  * (c) All other parts are to be classified in heading 8409,
  8431, 8448, 8466, 8473, 8503, 8522, 8529 or 8538 as appropriate or, failing that,
  in heading 8487 or 8548.\r\n* 3\\. Unless the context otherwise requires, composite
  machines consisting of two or more machines fitted together to form a whole and
  other machines designed for the purpose of performing two or more complementary
  or alternative functions are to be classified as if consisting only of that component
  or as being that machine which performs the principal function.\r\n* 4\\. Where
  a machine (including a combination of machines) consists of individual components
  (whether separate or interconnected by piping, by transmission devices, by electric
  cables or by other devices) intended to contribute together to a clearly defined
  function covered by one of the headings in Chapter 84 or 85, then the whole falls
  to be classified in the heading appropriate to that function.\r\n* 5\\. For the
  purposes of these notes, the expression 'machine' means any machine, machinery,
  plant, equipment, apparatus or appliance cited in the headings of Chapter 84 or
  85.\r\n\r\n## Additional notes ##\r\n\r\n* 1\\. Tools necessary for the assembly
  or maintenance of machines are to be classified with those machines if imported
  with them. Interchangeable tools imported with machines are also to be classified
  therewith if they form part of the normal equipment of the machines and are normally
  sold with them.\r\n* 2\\. Should the customs so require, the declarant shall produce,
  in support of his declaration, an illustrated document (for example, instructions,
  prospectus, a page from a catalogue, a photograph) giving the normal description
  of the machine, its uses and essential characteristics and, in respect of an unassembled
  or disassembled machine, an assembly plan and a list of the contents of the various
  packages.\r\n* 3\\. The provisions of general rule 2(a) are also applicable, at
  the request of the declarant and subject to conditions stipulated by the competent
  authorities, to machines imported in split consignments."
