  not motorised (heading 9603).\r\n* 2\\. Subject to the operation of note 3 to Section
  XVI and subject to note 9 to this chapter, a machine or appliance which answers
  to a description in one or more of the headings 8401 to 8424, or heading 8486 and
  at the same time to a description in one or other of the headings 8425 to 8480 is
  to be classified under the appropriate heading of the former group or under heading
  8486, as the case may be, and not the latter group.\r\nHeading 8419 does not, however,
  cover:\r\n  * (a) germination plant, incubators or brooders (heading 8436);\r\n
  \ * (b) grain dampening machines (heading 8437);\r\n  * (c) diffusing apparatus

  \ * (b) office machinery of heading 8472.\r\n* Heading 8424 does not cover:\r\n
  \ * (a) ink-jet printing machines (heading 8443); or\r\n  * (b) water-jet cutting
  machines (heading 8456).\r\n* 3\\. A machine tool for working any material which
  answers to a description in heading 8456 and at the same time to a description in
  heading 8457, 8458, 8459, 8460, 8461, 8464 or 8465 is to be classified in heading
  8456.\r\n* 4\\. Heading 8457 applies only to machine tools for working metal, other
  than lathes (including turning centres), which can carry out different types of
  machining operations either:\r\n  * (a) by automatic tool change from a magazine
  or the like in conformity with a machining programme (machining centres),\r\n  *
  (b) by the automatic use, simultaneously or sequentially, of different unit heads
  working on a fixed position workpiece (unit construction machines, single station);
  or\r\n  * (c) by the automatic transfer of the workpiece to different unit heads
  (multi-station transfer machines).\r\n* 5\\. (A) For the purposes of heading 8471,
  the expression 'automatic data-processing machines' means machines, capable of\r\n
  \ * (1) storing the processing program or programs and at least the data immediately
  necessary for the execution of the program;\r\n  * (2) being freely programmed in
  accordance with the requirements of the user;\r\n  * (3) performing arithmetical
  computations specified by the user; and\r\n  * (4) executing, without human intervention,
  a processing program which requires them to modify their execution, by logical decision
  during the processing run.\r\n* (B) Automatic data-processing machines may be in
  the form of systems consisting of a variable number of separate units.\r\n* (C)
  Subject to paragraphs (D) and (E) below, a unit is to be regarded as being a part
  of an automatic data processing system if it meets all the following conditions:\r\n
  \ * (1) it is of a kind solely or principally used in an automatic data-processing
  system;\r\n  * (2) it is connectable to the central processing unit either directly
  or through one or more other units; and\r\n  * (3) it is able to accept or deliver
  data in a form (codes or signals) which can be used by the system.\r\n  * Separately
  presented units of an automatic data-processing machine are to be classified in
  heading 8471.\r\n  * However keyboards, X-Y coordinate input devices and disk storage
  units which satisfy the conditions of paragraphs (C)(2) and (C)(3) above, are in
  all cases to be classified as units of heading 8471.\r\n* (D) Heading 8471 does
  not cover the following when presented separately, even if they meet all of the
  conditions set forth in note 5(C) above:\r\n  * (1) printers, copying machines,
  facsimile machines, whether or not combined;\r\n  * (2) apparatus for the transmission
  or reception of voice, images or other data, including apparatus for communication
  in a wired or wireless network (such as a local or wide area network);\r\n  * (3)
  loudspeakers and microphones;\r\n  * (4) television cameras, digital cameras and
  video camera recorders;\r\n  * (5) monitors and projectors, not incorporating television
  reception apparatus.\r\n  * (E) Machines incorporating or working in conjunction
  with an automatic data-processing machine and performaning a specific function other
  than data processing are to be classified in the headings appropriate to their respective
  functions or, failing that, in residual headings.\r\n* 6\\. Heading 8482 applies,
  inter alia, to polished steel balls, the maximum and minimum diameters of which
  do not differ from the nominal diameter by more than 1% or by more than 0.05 mm,
  whichever is less.\r\n  * Other steel balls are to be classified in heading 7326.\r\n*
  7\\. A machine which is used for more than one purpose is, for the purposes of classification,
  to be treated as if its principal purpose were its sole purpose.\r\n  * Subject
  to note 2 to this chapter and note 3 to Section XVI, a machine the principal purpose
  of which is not described in any heading or for which no one purpose is the principal
  purpose is, unless the context otherwise requires, to be classified in heading 8479.
  Heading 8479 also covers machines for making rope or cable (for example, stranding,
  twisting or cabling machines) from metal wire, textile yarn or any other material
  or from a combination of such materials.\r\n* 8\\. For the purposes of heading 8470,
  the term 'pocket-size' applies only to machines the dimensions of which do not exceed
  170 mm x 100 mm x 45 mm.\r\n* 9\\. (A) Notes 8(a) and 8(b) to Chapter 85 also apply
  with respect to the expressions 'semiconductor devices' and 'electronic integrated
  circuits', respectively, as used in this note and in heading 8486. However, for
  the purposes of this note and of heading 8486, the expression 'semiconductor devices'
  also covers photosensitive semiconductor devices and light emitting diodes.\r\n*
  (B) For the purposes of this note and of heading 8486, the expression 'manufacture
  of flat panel displays' covers the fabrication of substrates into a flat panel.
  It does not cover the manufacture of glass or the assembly of printed circuit boards
  or other electronic components onto the flat panel. The expression 'flat panel display'
  does not cover cathode-ray tube technology.\r\n* (C) Heading 8486 also includes
  machines and apparatus solely or principally of a kind used for:\r\n  * (1) the
  manufacture or repair of masks and reticles;\r\n  * (2) assembling semiconductor
  devices or electronic integrated circuits; and\r\n  * (3) lifting, handling, loading
  or unloading of boules, wafers, semiconductor devices, electronic integrated circuits
  and flat panel displays.\r\n* (D) Subject to note 1 to Section XVI and note 1 to
  Chapter 84, machines and apparatus answering to the description in heading 8486
  are to be classified in that heading and in no other heading of the nomenclature.\r\n\r\n##
  Subheading notes ##\r\n\r\n* 1\\. For the purposes of subheading 8471 49, the term
  'systems' means automatic data-processing machines whose units satisfy the conditions
  laid down in note 5 (C) to Chapter 84 and which comprise at least a central processing
  unit, one input unit (for example, a keyboard or a scanner), and one output unit
  (for example, a visual display unit or a printer).\r\n* 2\\. Subheading 8482 40
  applies only to bearings with cylindrical rollers of a uniform diameter not exceeding
  5 mm and having a length which is at least three times the diameter. The ends of
  the rollers may be rounded.\r\n\r\n## Additional notes ##\r\n\r\n* 1\\. For the
  purposes of subheadings 8407 10 and 8409 10, the expression 'aircraft engines' shall
  apply only to engines designed for fitting with an airscrew or rotor.\r\n* 2\\.
  Subheading 8471 70 30 shall also apply to CD-ROM drives, being storage units for
  automatic data processing machines, which consist of drive units designed for retrieving
  the signals from CD-ROMs, audio CDs and photo CDs and equipped with a jack for earphones,
  a volume-control button or a start/stop button."
