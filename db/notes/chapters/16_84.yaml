  2\\. Subject to the operation of note 3 to Section XVI and subject to note 9 to
  this chapter, a machine or appliance which answers to a description in one or more
  of the headings 8401 to 8424, or heading 8486 and at the same time to a description
  in one or other of the headings 8425 to 8480 is to be classified under the appropriate
  heading of the former group or under heading 8486, as the case may be, and not the
  latter group.\r\nHeading 8419 does not, however, cover:\r\n  * (a) germination plant,
  incubators or brooders (heading 8436);\r\n  * (b) grain dampening machines (heading

  A machine tool for working any material which answers to a description in heading
  8456 and at the same time to a description in heading 8457, 8458, 8459, 8460, 8461,
  8464 or 8465 is to be classified in heading 8456.\r\n* 4\\. Heading 8457 applies
  only to machine tools for working metal, other than lathes (including turning centres),
  which can carry out different types of machining operations either:\r\n  * (a) by
  automatic tool change from a magazine or the like in conformity with a machining
  programme (machining centres),\r\n  * (b) by the automatic use, simultaneously or
  sequentially, of different unit heads working on a fixed position workpiece (unit
  construction machines, single station); or\r\n  * (c) by the automatic transfer
  of the workpiece to different unit heads (multi-station transfer machines).\r\n*
  5\\. (A) For the purposes of heading 8471, the expression 'automatic data-processing
  machines' means machines, capable of\r\n  * (1) storing the processing program or
  programs and at least the data immediately necessary for the execution of the program;\r\n
  \ * (2) being freely programmed in accordance with the requirements of the user;\r\n
  \ * (3) performing arithmetical computations specified by the user; and\r\n  * (4)
  executing, without human intervention, a processing program which requires them
  to modify their execution, by logical decision during the processing run.\r\n* (B)
  Automatic data-processing machines may be in the form of systems consisting of a
  variable number of separate units.\r\n* (C) Subject to paragraphs (D) and (E) below,
  a unit is to be regarded as being a part of an automatic data processing system
  if it meets all the following conditions:\r\n  * (1) it is of a kind solely or principally
  used in an automatic data-processing system;\r\n  * (2) it is connectable to the
  central processing unit either directly or through one or more other units; and\r\n
  \ * (3) it is able to accept or deliver data in a form (codes or signals) which
  can be used by the system.\r\n  * Separately presented units of an automatic data-processing
  machine are to be classified in heading 8471.\r\n  * However keyboards, X-Y coordinate
  input devices and disk storage units which satisfy the conditions of paragraphs
  (C)(2) and (C)(3) above, are in all cases to be classified as units of heading 8471.\r\n*
  (D) Heading 8471 does not cover the following when presented separately, even if
  they meet all of the conditions set forth in note 5(C) above:\r\n  * (1) printers,
  copying machines, facsimile machines, whether or not combined;\r\n  * (2) apparatus
  for the transmission or reception of voice, images or other data, including apparatus
  for communication in a wired or wireless network (such as a local or wide area network);\r\n
  \ * (3) loudspeakers and microphones;\r\n  * (4) television cameras, digital cameras
  and video camera recorders;\r\n  * (5) monitors and projectors, not incorporating
  television reception apparatus.\r\n  * (E) Machines incorporating or working in
  conjunction with an automatic data-processing machine and performing a specific
  function other than data processing are to be classified in the headings appropriate
  to their respective functions or, failing that, in residual headings.\r\n* 6\\.
  Heading 8482 applies, inter alia, to polished steel balls, the maximum and minimum
  diameters of which do not differ from the nominal diameter by more than 1% or by
  more than 0.05 mm, whichever is less.\r\n  * Other steel balls are to be classified
  in heading 7326.\r\n* 7\\. A machine which is used for more than one purpose is,
  for the purposes of classification, to be treated as if its principal purpose were
  its sole purpose.\r\n  * Subject to note 2 to this chapter and note 3 to Section
  XVI, a machine the principal purpose of which is not described in any heading or
  for which no one purpose is the principal purpose is, unless the context otherwise
  requires, to be classified in heading 8479. Heading 8479 also covers machines for
  making rope or cable (for example, stranding, twisting or cabling machines) from
  metal wire, textile yarn or any other material or from a combination of such materials.\r\n*
  8\\. For the purposes of heading 8470, the term 'pocket-size' applies only to machines
  the dimensions of which do not exceed 170 mm x 100 mm x 45 mm.\r\n* 9\\. (A) Notes
  8(a) and 8(b) to Chapter 85 also apply with respect to the expressions 'semiconductor
  devices' and 'electronic integrated circuits', respectively, as used in this note
  and in heading 8486. However, for the purposes of this note and of heading 8486,
  the expression 'semiconductor devices' also covers photosensitive semiconductor
  devices and light emitting diodes.\r\n* (B) For the purposes of this note and of
  heading 8486, the expression 'manufacture of flat panel displays' covers the fabrication
  of substrates into a flat panel. It does not cover the manufacture of glass or the
  assembly of printed circuit boards or other electronic components onto the flat
  panel. The expression 'flat panel display' does not cover cathode-ray tube technology.\r\n*
  (C) Heading 8486 also includes machines and apparatus solely or principally of a
  kind used for:\r\n  * (1) the manufacture or repair of masks and reticles;\r\n  *
  (2) assembling semiconductor devices or electronic integrated circuits; and\r\n
  \ * (3) lifting, handling, loading or unloading of boules, wafers, semiconductor
  devices, electronic integrated circuits and flat panel displays.\r\n* (D) Subject
  to note 1 to Section XVI and note 1 to Chapter 84, machines and apparatus answering
  to the description in heading 8486 are to be classified in that heading and in no
  other heading of the nomenclature.\r\n\r\n## Subheading notes ##\r\n\r\n1. For the
  purposes of subheading 8465 20, the term machining centres applies only to machine-tools
  for working wood, cork, bone, hard rubber, hard plastics or similar hard materials,
  which can carry out different types of machining operations by automatic tool change
  from a magazine or the like in conformity with a machining programme.\r\n\r\n2.
  For the purposes of subheading 8471 49, the term systems means automatic data-processing
  machines whose units satisfy the conditions laid down in note 5(C) to Chapter 84
  and which comprise at least a central processing unit, one input unit (for example,
  a keyboard or a scanner), and one output unit (for example, a visual display unit
  or a printer).\r\n\r\n3. For the purposes of subheading 8481 20, the expression
  valves for oleohydraulic or pneumatic transmissions means valves which are used
  specifically in the transmission of fluid power in a hydraulic or pneumatic system,
  where the energy source is supplied in the form of pressurized fluids (liquid or
  gas). These valves may be of any type (for example, pressure-reducing type, check
  type). Subheading 8481 20 takes precedence over all other subheadings of heading
  8481.\r\n\r\n4. Subheading 8482 40 applies only to bearings with cylindrical rollers
  of a uniform diameter not exceeding 5 mm and having a length which is at least three
  times the diameter. The ends of the rollers may be rounded.\r\n\r\n## Additional
  notes ##\r\n\r\n* 1\\. For the purposes of subheadings 8407 10 and 8409 10, the
  expression 'aircraft engines' shall apply only to engines designed for fitting with
  an airscrew or rotor.\r\n* 2\\. Subheading 8471 70 30 shall also apply to CD-ROM
  drives, being storage units for automatic data processing machines, which consist
  of drive units designed for retrieving the signals from CD-ROMs, audio CDs and photo
  CDs and equipped with a jack for earphones, a volume-control button or a start/stop
  button."
