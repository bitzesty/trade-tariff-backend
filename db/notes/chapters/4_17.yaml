:content: "* 1\\. This chapter does not cover:\r\n  * (a) sugar confectionery containing
  cocoa (heading 1806);\r\n  * (b) chemically pure sugars (other than sucrose, lactose,
  maltose, glucose and fructose) or other products of heading 2940; or\r\n  * (c)
  medicaments or other products of Chapter 30.\r\n\r\n## Subheading notes ##\r\n\r\n*
  1\\. For the purposes of subheadings 1701 12, 1701 13 and 1701 14, 'raw sugar' means
  sugar whose content of sucrose by weight, in the dry state, corresponds to a polarimeter
  reading of less than 99.5.\r\n* 2\\. Subheading 1701 13 covers only cane sugar obtained
  without centrifugation, whose content of sucrose by weight, in the dry state, corresponds
  to a polarimeter reading of 69 or more but less than 93. The product contains only
  natural antiedral microcrystals, of irregular shape, not visible to the naked eye,
  which are surrounded by residue of molasses and other constituents of sugar cane.\r\n\r\n##
  Additional notes ##\r\n\r\n* 1\\. For the purpose of subheadings 1701 12 10, 1701
  12 90, 1701 13 10, 1701 13 90, 1701 14 10 and 1701 14 90 'raw sugar' means sugar,
  not flavoured or coloured or containing any other added substances, containing,
  in the dry state, less than 99.5% by weight of sucrose determined by the polarimetric
  method.\r\n* 2\\. The duty applicable to raw sugar of subheadings 1701 12 10, 1701
  13 10 and 1701 14 10 whose yield established according to part B(III) of Annex III
  to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ
  L 347, 20.12.2013, p. 671) differs from 92 % is fixed in the following manner: the
  relevant rate is multiplied by a correcting coefficient obtained by dividing the
  percentage yield established according to the above provisions by 92.\r\n* 3\\.
  For the purposes of subheading 1701 99 10, 'white sugar' means sugar, not flavoured
  or coloured or containing any other added substances, containing, in the dry state,
  99.5% or more by weight of sucrose, determined by the polarimetric method.\r\n*
  4\\. For products of subheadings 1702 2010, 1702 6095 and 1702 9071 the sugar content
  (sucrose, fructose, glucose and maltose, where the\r\nfructose and glucose are expressed
  in sucrose equivalent) is to be determined by applying the high performance liquid
  chromatography method (the\r\nHPLC method), using the following formula:\r\nS +
  0,95 x (F + G) + M\r\nwhere:\r\nS is the sucrose content determined by the HPLC
  method;\r\nF is the fructose content determined by the HPLC method;\r\nG is the
  glucose content determined by the HPLC method;\r\nM is the maltose content determined
  by the HPLC method.\r\nFor products of subheadings 1702 60 80, 1702 90 80 and 1702
  90 95, the sucrose content, including other sugars expressed as sucrose, is to be\r\ndetermined
  by the refractometry method (expressed in degrees Brix in accordance with the Annex
  to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU)\r\nNo 974/2014 (1)). For products of
  subheadings 1702 60 80 and 1702 90 80, the conversion of the results into sucrose
  equivalent is to be obtained by multiplying the degrees Brix by the coefficient
  0,95.\r\n* 5\\. For the purposes of subheadings 1702 30 10, 1702 40 10, 1702 60
  10 and 1702 90 30, 'isoglucose' means the product obtained from glucose or its polymers
  with a content by weight in the dry state of at least 10% fructose.\r\n For products
  of those subheadings, the sucrose content, including other sugars expressed as sucrose,
  is to be determined by the refractometry method\r\n(expressed in degrees Brix in
  accordance with the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 974/2014). \r\n * 6\\.
  'Inulin syrup' means:\r\n  * (a) for the purposes of subheading 1702 60 80 the immediate
  product obtained by hydrolysis of inulin or oligofructoses, containing in the dry
  state more than 50% fructose in free form or as sucrose;\r\n  * (b) for the purposes
  of subheading 1702 90 80 the immediate product obtained by hydrolysis of inulin
  or oligofructoses, containing in the dry state at least 10% but not more than 50%
  of fructose in free form or as sucrose.\r\nThe quantity of \"fructose in free form
  or as sucrose\" shall be determined using the formula F + 0.5 S/0.95 calculated
  on the dry matter, where \"F\" is the fructose content and \"S\" is the sucrose
  content, as determined by the High Performance Liquid Chromatography method.\r\n*
  7\\. When imported in the form of an assortment, goods of subheading 1704 90 are
  subject to an agricultural component (EA) fixed according to the average content
  in milk fats, milk proteins, sucrose, isoglucose, glucose and starch of the assortment
  as a whole.\r\n* 8\\. Throughout the Combined Nomenclature, mixtures of sugar with
  small amounts of other substances are classified in Chapter 17 unless they have
  the character of a preparation classified elsewhere."
