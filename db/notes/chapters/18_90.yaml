  depends on an electrical phenomenon which varies according to the factor to be automatically
  controlled, which are designed to bring this factor to, and maintain it at, a desired
  value, stabilised against disturbances, by constantly or periodically measuring
  its actual value; and\r\n  * (b) automatic regulators of electrical quantities,
  and instruments or apparatus for automatically controlling non-electrical quantities
  the operation of which depends on an electrical phenomenon varying according to
  the factor to be controlled, which are designed to bring this factor to, and maintain
