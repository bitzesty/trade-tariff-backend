:content: "1.\r\nThroughout the nomenclature, the expression plastics means those
  materials of headings 3901 to 3914 which are or have been capable, either at the
  moment of polymerisation or at some subsequent stage, of being formed under external
  influence (usually heat and pressure, if necessary with a solvent or plasticiser)
  by moulding, casting, extruding, rolling or other process into shapes which are
  retained on the removal of the external influence.\r\nThroughout the nomenclature,
  any reference to plastics also includes vulcanised fibre. The expression, however,
  does not apply to materials regarded as textile materials of Section XI.\r\n\r\n2
  This chapter does not cover:\r\n\r\n(a) lubricating preparations of heading 2710
  or 3403;\r\n\r\n(b) waxes of heading 2712 or 3404;\r\n\r\n(c) separate chemically
  defined organic compounds (Chapter 29);\r\n\r\n(d) heparin or its salts (heading
  3001);\r\n\r\n(e) solutions (other than collodions) consisting of any of the products
  specified in headings 3901 to 3913 in volatile organic solvents when the weight
  of the solvent exceeds 50 % of the weight of the solution (heading 3208); stamping
  foils of heading 3212;\r\n\r\n(f) organic surface-active agents or preparations
  of heading 3402;\r\n\r\n(g) run gums or ester gums (heading 3806);\r\n\r\n(h) prepared
  additives for mineral oils (including gasoline) or for other liquids used for the
  same purposes as mineral oils (heading 3811);\r\n\r\n(ij) prepared hydraulic fluids
  based on polyglycols, silicones or other polymers of Chapter 39 (heading 3819);\r\n\r\n(k)
  diagnostic or laboratory reagents on a backing of plastics (heading 3822);\r\n\r\n(l)
  synthetic rubber, as defined for the purposes of Chapter 40, or articles thereof;\r\n\r\n(m)
  saddlery or harness (heading 4201) or trunks, suitcases, handbags or other containers
  of heading 4202;\r\n\r\n(n) plaits, wickerwork or other articles of Chapter 46;\r\n\r\n(o)
  wallcoverings of heading 4814;\r\n\r\n(p) goods of Section XI (textiles and textile
  articles); \r\n(q) articles of Section XII (for example, footwear, headgear, umbrellas,
  sun umbrellas, walking sticks, whips, riding-crops or parts thereof);\r\n\r\n(r)
  imitation jewellery of heading 7117;\r\n\r\n(s) articles of Section XVI (machines
  and mechanical or electrical appliances);\r\n\r\n(t)parts of aircraft or vehicles
  of Section XVII;\r\n\r\n(u) articles of Chapter 90 (for example, optical elements,
  spectacle frames, drawing instruments);\r\n\r\n(v) articles of Chapter 91 (for example,
  clock or watch cases);\r\n\r\n(w) articles of Chapter 92 (for example, musical instruments
  or parts thereof);\r\n\r\n(x) articles of Chapter 94 (for example, furniture, lamps
  and lighting fittings, illuminated signs, prefabricated buildings);\r\n\r\n(y) articles
  of Chapter 95 (for example, toys, games, sports requisites); or\r\n\r\n(z) articles
  of Chapter 96 (for example, brushes, buttons, slide fasteners, combs, mouthpieces
  or stems for smoking pipes, cigarette- holders or the like, parts of vacuum flasks
  or the like, pens, propelling pencils, and monopods, bipods, tripods and similar
  articles).\r\n\r\n3.Headings 3901 to 3911 apply only to goods of a kind produced
  by chemical synthesis, falling in the following categories:\r\n\r\n(a) liquid synthetic
  polyolefins of which less than 60 % by volume distils at 300 C, after conversion
  to 1 013 mbar when a reduced- pressure distillation method is used (headings 3901
  and 3902);\r\n\r\n(b) resins, not highly polymerised, of the coumarone-indene type
  (heading 3911);\r\n\r\n(c) other synthetic polymers with an average of at least
  five monomer units;\r\n\r\n(d) silicones (heading 3910);\r\n\r\n(e) resols (heading
  3909) and other prepolymers.\r\n\r\n4.The expression copolymers covers all polymers
  in which no single monomer unit contributes 95 % or more by weight to the total
  polymer content.\r\nFor the purposes of this chapter, except where the context otherwise
  requires, copolymers (including co-polycondensates, co- polyaddition products, block
  copolymers and graft copolymers) and polymer blends are to be classified in the
  heading covering polymers of that comonomer unit which predominates by weight over
  every other single comonomer unit. For the purposes of this note, constituent comonomer
  units of polymers falling in the same heading shall be taken together.\r\nIf no
  single comonomer unit predominates, copolymers or polymer blends, as the case may
  be, are to be classified in the heading which occurs last in numerical order among
  those which equally merit consideration.\r\n\r\n5.Chemically modified polymers,
  that is those in which only appendages to the main polymer chain have been changed
  by chemical reaction, are to be classified in the heading appropriate to the unmodified
  polymer. This provision does not apply to graft copolymers.\r\n\r\n6.In headings
  3901 to 3914, the expression primary forms applies only to the following forms:\r\n\r\n(a)
  liquids and pastes, including dispersions (emulsions and suspensions) and solutions;\r\n\r\n(b)
  blocks of irregular shape, lumps, powders (including moulding powders), granules,
  flakes and similar bulk forms.\r\n\r\n7.Heading 3915 does not apply to waste, parings
  and scrap of a single thermoplastic material, transformed into primary forms (headings
  3901 to 3914).\r\n\r\n8.For the purposes of heading 3917, the expression tubes,
  pipes and hoses means hollow products, whether semi-manufactured or finished products,
  of a kind generally used for conveying, conducting or distributing gases or liquids
  (for example, ribbed garden hose, perforated tubes). This expression also includes
  sausage casings and other lay-flat tubing. However, except for the last mentioned,
  those having an internal cross-section other than round, oval, rectangular (in which
  the length does not exceed one-and-a-half times the width) or in the shape of a
  regular polygon are not to be regarded as tubes, pipes and hoses but as profile
  shapes.\r\n\r\n9.For the purposes of heading 3918, the expression wall or ceiling
  coverings of plastics applies to products in rolls, of a width not less than 45
  cm, suitable for wall or ceiling decoration, consisting of plastics fixed permanently
  on a backing of any material other than paper, the layer of plastics (on the face
  side) being grained, embossed, coloured, design-printed or otherwise decorated.\r\n\r\n10.In
  headings 3920 and 3921, the expression plates, sheets, film, foil and strip applies
  only to plates, sheets, film, foil and strip (other than those of Chapter 54) and
  to blocks of regular geometric shape, whether or not printed or otherwise surface-worked,
  uncut or cut into rectangles (including squares) but not further worked (even if
  when so cut they become articles ready for use).\r\n\r\n11.Heading 3925 applies
  only to the following articles, not being products covered by any of the earlier
  headings of sub-chapter II:\r\n\r\n(a) reservoirs, tanks (including septic tanks),
  vats and similar containers, of a capacity exceeding 300 litres;\r\n\r\n(b) structural
  elements used, for example, in floors, walls or partitions, ceilings or roofs;\r\n\r\n(c)
  gutters and fittings therefor;\r\n\r\n(d) doors, windows and their frames and thresholds
  for doors;\r\n\r\n(e) balconies, balustrades, fencing, gates and similar barriers;\r\n\r\n(f)
  shutters, blinds (including venetian blinds) and similar articles and parts and
  fittings thereof;\r\n\r\n(g) large-scale shelving for assembly and permanent installation,
  for example, in shops, workshops, warehouses;\r\n\r\n(h) ornamental architectural
  features, for example, flutings, cupolas, dovecotes; and\r\n\r\n(ij) fittings and
  mountings intended for permanent installation in or on doors, windows, staircases,
  walls or other parts of buildings, for example, knobs, handles, hooks, brackets,
  towel rails, switch-plates and other protective plates.\r\n\r\n## Subheading notes
  ##\r\n\r\n1.Within any one heading of this chapter, polymers (including copolymers)
  and chemically modified polymers are to be classified according to the following
  provisions:\r\n\r\n(a) where there is a subheading named Other in the same series:\r\n\r\n(1)
  the designation in a subheading of a polymer by the prefix poly (for example, polyethylene
  and polyamide-6,6) means that the constituent monomer unit or monomer units of the
  named polymer taken together must contribute 95 % or more by weight of the total
  polymer content;\r\n\r\n(2) the copolymers named in subheadings 3901 30, 3901 40,
  3903 20, 3903 30 and 3904 30 are to be classified in those subheadings, provided
  that the comonomer units of the named copolymers contribute 95 % or more by weight
  of the total polymer content;\r\n\r\n(3) chemically modified polymers are to be
  classified in the subheading named Other, provided that the chemically modified
  polymers are not more specifically covered by another subheading;\r\n\r\n(4) polymers
  not meeting (1), (2) or (3) above, are to be classified in the subheading, among
  the remaining subheadings in the series, covering polymers of that monomer unit
  which predominates by weight over every other single comonomer unit. For this purpose,
  constituent monomer units of polymers falling in the same subheading shall be taken
  together. Only the constituent comonomer units of the polymers in the series of
  subheadings under consideration are to be compared;\r\n\r\n  (b) where there is
  no subheading named Other in the same series:\r\n\r\n(1) polymers are to be classified
  in the subheading covering polymers of that monomer unit which predominates by weight
  over every other single comonomer unit. For this purpose, constituent monomer units
  of polymers falling in the same subheading shall be taken together. Only the constituent
  comonomer units of the polymers in the series under consideration are to be compared;\r\n\r\n(2)
  chemically modified polymers are to be classified in the subheading appropriate
  to the unmodified polymer.\r\n\r\nPolymer blends are to be classified in the same
  subheading as polymers of the same monomer units in the same proportions.\r\n\r\n2.For
  the purposes of subheading 3920 43, the term plasticisers includes secondary plasticisers.\r\n\r\n##
  Additional note ##\r\n\r\n1. Where the woven, knitted or crocheted fabrics, felt
  or nonwovens are present merely for reinforcing purposes, gloves, mittens or mitts
  impregnated, coated or covered with cellular plastics belong to Chapter 39, even
  if they are:\r\n\r\n made up from woven, knitted or crocheted fabrics (other than
  those of heading 5903), felt or nonwovens impregnated, coated or covered with cellular
  plastics, or\r\n\r\n made up from unimpregnated, uncoated or uncovered woven, knitted
  or crocheted fabrics, felt or nonwovens and subsequently impregnated, coated or
  covered with cellular plastics.\r\n(Note 3(c) to Chapter 56 and note 2(a)(5) to
  Chapter 59)."
