:content: "* 1\\. Throughout the nomenclature, the expression 'plastics' means those
  materials of headings 3901 to 3914 which are or have been capable, either at the
  moment of polymerisation or at some subsequent stage, of being formed under external
  influence (usually heat and pressure, if necessary with a solvent or plasticiser)
  by moulding, casting, extruding, rolling or other process into shapes which are
  retained on the removal of the external influence.\r\n* Throughout the nomenclature,
  any reference to 'plastics' also includes vulcanised fibre. The expression, however,
  does not apply to materials regarded as textile materials of Section XI.\r\n* 2\\.
  This chapter does not cover:\r\n  * (a) lubricating preparations of heading 2710
  or 3403;\r\n  * (b) waxes of heading 2712 or 3404;\r\n  * (c) separate chemically
  defined organic compounds (Chapter 29);\r\n  * (d) heparin or its salts (heading
  3001);\r\n  * (e) solutions (other than collodions) consisting of any of the products
  specified in headings 3901 to 3913 in volatile organic solvents when the weight
  of the solvent exceeds 50% of the weight of the solution (heading 3208); stamping
  foils of heading 3212;\r\n  * (f) organic surface-active agents or preparations
  of heading 3402;\r\n  * (g) run gums or ester gums (heading 3806);\r\n  * (h) prepared
  additives for mineral oils (including gasoline) or for other liquids used for the
  same purposes as mineral oils (heading 3811);\r\n  * (ij) prepared hydraulic fluids
  based on polyglycols, silicones or other polymers of Chapter 39 (heading 3819);\r\n
  \ * (k) diagnostic or laboratory reagents on a backing of plastics (heading 3822);\r\n
  \ * (l) synthetic rubber, as defined for the purposes of Chapter 40, or articles
  thereof;\r\n  * (m) saddlery or harness (heading 4201) or trunks, suitcases, handbags
  or other containers of heading 4202;\r\n  * (n) plaits, wickerwork or other articles
  of Chapter 46;\r\n  * (o) wallcoverings of heading 4814;\r\n  * (p) goods of Section
  XI (textiles and textile articles);\r\n  * (q) articles of Section XII (for example,
  footwear, headgear, umbrellas, sun umbrellas, walking sticks, whips, riding-crops
  or parts thereof);\r\n  * (r) imitation jewellery of heading 7117;\r\n  * (s) articles

  buildings);\r\n  * (y) articles of Chapter 95 (for example, toys, games, sports
  requisites); or\r\n  * (z) articles of Chapter 96 (for example, brushes, buttons,
  slide fasteners, combs, mouthpieces or stems for smoking pipes, cigarette-holders
  or the like, parts of vacuum flasks or the like, pens, propelling pencils).\r\n*
  3\\. Headings 3901 to 3911 apply only to goods of a kind produced by chemical synthesis,
  falling in the following categories:\r\n  * (a) liquid synthetic polyolefins of
  which less than 60% by volume distils at 300 C, after conversion to 1,013 mbar when
  a reduced-pressure distillation method is used (headings 3901 and 3902);\r\n  *
  (b) resins, not highly polymerised, of the coumarone-indene type (heading 3911);\r\n
  \ * (c) other synthetic polymers with an average of at least five monomer units;\r\n
  \ * (d) silicones (heading 3910);\r\n  * (e) resols (heading 3909) and other prepolymers.\r\n*
  \\4. The expression 'copolymers' covers all polymers in which no single monomer
  unit contributes 95% or more by weight to the total polymer content.\r\n* For the
  purposes of this chapter, except where the context otherwise requires, copolymers
  (including co-polycondensates, co-polyaddition products, block copolymers and graft
  copolymers) and polymer blends are to be classified in the heading covering polymers
  of that comonomer unit which predominates by weight over every other single comonomer
  unit. For the purposes of this note, constituent comonomer units of polymers falling
  in the same heading shall be taken together.\r\n* If no single comonomer unit predominates,
  copolymers or polymer blends, as the case may be, are to be classified in the heading
  which occurs last in numerical order among those which equally merit consideration.\r\n*
  5\\. Chemically modified polymers, that is those in which only appendages to the
  main polymer chain have been changed by chemical reaction, are to be classified
  in the heading appropriate to the unmodified polymer. This provision does not apply
  to graft copolymers.\r\n* 6\\. In headings 3901 to 3914, the expression 'primary
  forms' applies only to the following forms:\r\n  * (a) liquids and pastes, including
  dispersions (emulsions and suspensions) and solutions;\r\n  * (b) blocks of irregular
  shape, lumps, powders (including moulding powders), granules, flakes and similar
  bulk forms.\r\n* 7\\. Heading 3915 does not apply to waste, parings and scrap of
  a single thermoplastic material, transformed into primary forms (headings 3901 to
  3914).\r\n* 8\\. For the purposes of heading 3917, the expression 'tubes, pipes
  and hoses' means hollow products, whether semi-manufactured or finished products,
  of a kind generally used for conveying, conducting or distributing gases or liquids
  (for example, ribbed garden hose, perforated tubes).\r\n* This expression also includes
  sausage casings and other lay-flat tubing. However, except for the last-mentioned,
  those having an internal cross-section other than round, oval, rectangular (in which
  the length does not exceed one-and-a-half times the width) or in the shape of a
  regular polygon are not to be regarded as tubes, pipes and hoses but as profile
  shapes.\r\n* 9\\. For the purposes of heading 3918, the expression 'wall or ceiling
  coverings of plastics' applies to products in rolls, of a width not less than 45cm,
  suitable for wall or ceiling decoration, consisting of plastics fixed permanently
  on a backing of any material other than paper, the layer of plastics (on the face
  side) being grained, embossed, coloured, design-printed or otherwise decorated.\r\n*
  10\\. In headings 3920 and 3921, the expression 'plates, sheets, film, foil and
  strip' applies only to plates, sheets, film, foil and strip (other than those of
  Chapter 54) and to blocks of regular geometric shape, whether or not printed or
  otherwise surface-worked, uncut or cut into rectangles (including squares) but not
  further worked (even if when so cut they become articles ready for use).\r\n* 11\\.
  Heading 3925 applies only to the following articles, not being products covered
  by any of the earlier headings of sub-chapter II:\r\n  * (a) reservoirs, tanks (including
  septic tanks), vats and similar containers, of a capacity exceeding 300 litres;\r\n
  \ * (b) structural elements used, for example, in floors, walls or partitions, ceilings
  or roofs;\r\n  * (c) gutters and fittings therefor;\r\n  * (d) doors, windows and
  their frames and thresholds for doors;\r\n  * (e) balconies, balustrades, fencing,
  gates and similar barriers;\r\n  * (f) shutters, blinds (including Venetian blinds)
  and similar articles and parts and fittings thereof;\r\n  * (g) large-scale shelving
  for assembly and permanent installation, for example, in shops, workshops, warehouses;\r\n
  \ * (h) ornamental architectural features, for example, flutings, cupolas, dovecotes;
  and\r\n  * (ij) fittings and mountings intended for permanent installation in or
  on doors, windows, staircases, walls or other parts of buildings, for example, knobs,
  handles, hooks, brackets, towel rails, switch-plates and other protective plates.\r\n\r\n##
  Subheading notes ##\r\n\r\n* 1\\. Within any one heading of this chapter, polymers
  (including copolymers) and chemically modified polymers are to be classified according
  to the following provisions:\r\n  * (a) Where there is a subheading named 'Other'
  in the same series:\r\n    * (1) the designation in a subheading of a polymer by
  the prefix 'poly' (for example, polyethylene and polyamide-6,6) means that the constituent
  monomer unit or monomer units of the named polymer taken together must contribute
  95% or more by weight of the total polymer content;\r\n    * (2) the copolymers
  named in subheadings 3901 30, 3903 20, 3903 30 and 3904 30 are to be classified
  in those subheadings, provided that the comonomer units of the named copolymers
  contribute 95% or more by weight of the total polymer content;\r\n    * (3) chemically
  modified polymers are to be classified in the subheading named 'Other', provided
  that the chemically modified polymers are not more specifically covered by another
  subheading;\r\n    * (4) polymers not meeting (1), (2) or (3) above, are to be classified
  in the subheading, among the remaining subheadings in the series, covering polymers
  of that monomer unit which predominates by weight over every other single comonomer
  unit. For this purpose, constituent monomer units of polymers falling in the same
  subheading shall be taken together. Only the constituent comonomer units of the
  polymers in the series of subheadings under consideration are to be compared;\r\n
  \ * (b) Where there is no subheading named 'Other' in the same series:\r\n    *
  (1) polymers are to be classified in the subheading covering polymers of that monomer
  unit which predominates by weight over every other single comonomer unit. For this
  purpose, constituent monomer units of polymers falling in the same subheading shall
  be taken together. Only the constituent comonomer units of the polymers in the series
  under consideration are to be compared;\r\n    * (2) Chemically modified polymers
  are to be classified in the subheading appropriate to the unmodified polymer.\r\n
  \   * Polymer blends are to classified in the same subheading as polymers of the
  same monomer units in the same proportions.\r\n* 2\\. For the purposes of subheading
  3920 43, the term 'plasticisers' includes secondary plasticisers.\r\n\r\n## Additional
  note ##\r\n\r\n* Where the woven, knitted or crocheted fabrics, felt or nonwovens
  are present merely for reinforcing purposes, gloves, mittens or mitts impregnated,
  coated or covered with cellular plastics belong to Chapter 39, even if they are:\r\n
  \ * - made up from woven, knitted or crocheted fabrics (other than those of heading
  5903), felt or nonwovens impregnated, coated or covered with cellular plastics,
  or\r\n  * - made up from unimpregnated, uncoated or uncovered woven, knitted or
  crocheted fabrics, felt or nonwovens and subsequently impregnated, coated or covered
  with cellular plastics.\r\n(Note 3(c) to Chapter 56 and note 2(a)(5) to Chapter
