:content: "* 1\\. This chapter does not cover:\r\n  * (a) electrically warmed blankets,
  bed pans, foot-muffs or the like; electrically warmed clothing, footwear or ear
  pads or other electrically warmed articles worn on or about the person;\r\n  * (b)
  articles of glass of heading 7011;\r\n  * (c) machines and apparatus of heading
  8486;\r\n  * (d) vacuum apparatus of a kind used in medical, surgical, dental or
  veterinary science (heading 9018); or\r\n  * (e) electrically heated furniture of
  Chapter 94.\r\n* 2\\. Headings 8501 to 8504 do not apply to goods described in heading
  8511, 8512, 8540, 8541 or 8542.\r\n* However, metal tank mercury arc rectifiers
  remain classified in heading 8504.\r\n* 3\\. Heading 8509 covers only the following
  electromechanical machines of the kind commonly used for domestic purposes:\r\n
  \ * (a) floor polishers, food grinders and mixers, and fruit or vegetable juice
  extractors, of any weight;\r\n  * (b) other machines provided the weight of such
  machines does not exceed 20kg. The heading does not, however, apply to fans or ventilating
  or recycling hoods incorporating a fan, whether or not fitted with filters (heading
  8414), centrifugal clothes-dryers (heading 8421), dishwashing machines (heading
  8422), household washing machines (heading 8450), roller or other ironing machines
  (heading 8420 or 8451), sewing machines (heading 8452), electric scissors (heading
  8467) or to electro-thermic appliances (heading 8516).\r\n* 4\\. For the purposes
  of heading 8523:\r\n  * (a) 'solid-state non-volatile storage devices' (for example,
  'flash memory cards' or 'flash electronic storage cards')\r\nare storage devices
  with a connecting socket, comprising in the same housing one or more flash memories
  (for example, 'Flash E2PROM') in the form of integrated circuits mounted on a printed
  circuit board. They may include a controller in the form of an integrated circuit
  and discrete passive components, such as capacitors and resistors;\r\n  * (b) the
  term 'smart cards' means cards which have embedded in them one or more electronic
  integrated circuits (a microprocessor, random access memory (RAM) or read-only memory
  (ROM)) in the form of chips. These cards may contain contacts, a magnetic stripe
  or an embedded antenna but do not contain any other active or passive circuit elements.\r\n*
  5\\. For the purposes of heading 8534, 'printed circuits' are circuits obtained
  by forming on an insulating base, by any printing process (for example, embossing,
  plating-up, etching) or by the 'film circuit' technique, conductor elements, contacts
  or other printed components (for example, inductances, resistors, capacitors) alone
  or interconnected according to a pre-established pattern, other than elements which
  can produce, rectify, modulate or amplify an electrical signal (for example, semiconductor
  elements).\r\n* The expression 'printed circuits' does not cover circuits combined
  with elements other than those obtained during the printing process, nor does it
  cover individual, discrete resistors, capacitors or inductances. Printed circuits
  may, however, be fitted with non-printed connecting elements.\r\n* Thin- or thick-film
  circuits comprising passive and active elements obtained during the same technological
  process are to be classified in heading 8542.\r\n* 6\\. For the purpose of heading
  8536, 'connectors for optical fibres, optical fibre-bundles or cables' means connectors
  that simply mechanically align optical fibres end to end in a digital line system.
  They perform no other function, such as the amplification, regeneration or modification
  of a signal.\r\n* 7\\. Heading 8537 does not include cordless infrared devices for
  the remote control of television receivers or other electrical equipment (heading
  8543).\r\n* 8\\. For the purpose of headings 8541 and 8542:\r\n  * (a) 'Diodes,
  transistors and similar semiconductor devices' are semiconductor devices the operation
  of which depends on variations in resistivity on the application of an electric
  field.\r\n  * (b) 'Electronic integrated circuits' are:\r\n    * (1) monolithic
  integrated circuits in which the circuit elements (diodes, transistors, resistors,
  capacitors, inductances, etc.) are created in the mass (essentially) and on the
  surface of a semiconductor or compound semiconductor material (for example doped
  silicon, gallium arsenide, silicon germanium, lndium phosphide) and are inseparably
  associated;\r\n    * (2) hybrid integrated circuits in which passive elements (resistors,
  capacitors, inductances, etc), obtained by thin-or thick-film technology, and active
  elements (diodes, transistors, monolithic integrated circuits, etc.), obtained by
  semiconductor technology, are combined to all intents and purposes indivisibly,
  by interconnections or inter connecting cables, on a single insulating substrate
  (glass, ceramic, etc.). These circuits may also include discrete components;\r\n
  \   * (3) multichip integrated circuits consisting of two or more interconnected
  monolithic integrated circuits combined to all intents and purposes indivisibly,
  whether or not on one or more insulating substrates, with or without leadframes,
  but with no other active or passive circuit elements.\r\n* For the classification
  of the articles defined in this note, headings 8541 and 8542 shall take precedence
  over any other heading in the nomenclature, except in the case of heading 8523,
  which might cover them by reference to, in particular, their function.\r\n* 9\\.
  For the purposes of heading 8548, 'spent primary cells, spent primary batteries
  and spent electric accumulators' are those which are neither usable as such because
  of breakage, cutting-up, wear or other reasons, nor capable of being recharged.\r\n\r\n##
  Subheading notes ##\r\n\r\n* 1\\. Subheading 8527 12 covers only cassette-players
  with built-in amplifier, without built-in loudspeaker, capable of operating without
  an external source of electric power and the dimensions of which do not exceed 170
  mm x 100 mm x 45 mm.\r\n\r\n## Additional notes ##\r\n\r\n* 1\\. Subheadings 8519
  20 10, 8519 30 00 and 8519 89 11 are to be taken not to apply to sound reproducing
  apparatus with laser reading system.\r\n* 2\\. Subheading note 1 is applicable,
  _mutatis mutandis_, to subheadings 8519 81 15 and 8519 81 65.\r\n* 3\\. For the
  purposes of subheadings 8528 71 15 and 8528 71 91 only, the term 'modem' covers
  devices or equipment that modulate and demodulate incoming and outgoing signals,
  such as V.90-modems or cable modems, and other devices that use like technologies
  for gaining access to the internet, such as VLAN, ISDN and ethernet. The extent
  of access to the internet may be limited by the service provider.\r\n* Apparatus
  of these subheadings must enable a two-way communication process or the two-way
  flow of information for the purposes of providing interactive information exchange."
