  8511, 8512, 8540, 8541 or 8542.\r\n* However, metal tank mercury arc rectifiers
  remain classified in heading 8504.\r\n* 3\\. For the purposes of heading 8507, the
  expression electric accumulators includes those presented with ancillary components
  which contribute to the accumulators function of storing and supplying energy or
  protect it from damage, such as electrical connectors, temperature control devices
  (e.g., thermistors) and circuit protection devices. They may also include a portion
  of the protective housing of the goods in which they are to be used. \r\n* 4\\.
  Heading 8509 covers only the following electromechanical machines of the kind commonly
  used for domestic purposes:\r\n  * (a) floor polishers, food grinders and mixers,
  and fruit or vegetable juice extractors, of any weight;\r\n  * (b) other machines

  however, apply to fans or ventilating or recycling hoods incorporating a fan, whether
  or not fitted with filters (heading 8414), centrifugal clothes-dryers (heading 8421),
  dishwashing machines (heading 8422), household washing machines (heading 8450),
  roller or other ironing machines (heading 8420 or 8451), sewing machines (heading
  8452), electric scissors (heading 8467) or to electro-thermic appliances (heading
  8516).\r\n* 5\\. For the purposes of heading 8523:\r\n  * (a) 'solid-state non-volatile
  storage devices' (for example, 'flash memory cards' or 'flash electronic storage
  cards')\r\nare storage devices with a connecting socket, comprising in the same
  housing one or more flash memories (for example, 'Flash E2PROM') in the form of
  integrated circuits mounted on a printed circuit board. They may include a controller
  in the form of an integrated circuit and discrete passive components, such as capacitors
  and resistors;\r\n  * (b) the term 'smart cards' means cards which have embedded
  in them one or more electronic integrated circuits (a microprocessor, random access
  memory (RAM) or read-only memory (ROM)) in the form of chips. These cards may contain
  contacts, a magnetic stripe or an embedded antenna but do not contain any other
  active or passive circuit elements.\r\n* 6\\. For the purposes of heading 8534,
  'printed circuits' are circuits obtained by forming on an insulating base, by any
  printing process (for example, embossing, plating-up, etching) or by the 'film circuit'
  technique, conductor elements, contacts or other printed components (for example,
  inductances, resistors, capacitors) alone or interconnected according to a pre-established
  pattern, other than elements which can produce, rectify, modulate or amplify an
  electrical signal (for example, semiconductor elements).\r\n* The expression 'printed
  circuits' does not cover circuits combined with elements other than those obtained
  during the printing process, nor does it cover individual, discrete resistors, capacitors
  or inductances. Printed circuits may, however, be fitted with non-printed connecting
  elements.\r\n* Thin- or thick-film circuits comprising passive and active elements
  obtained during the same technological process are to be classified in heading 8542.\r\n*

  or cables' means connectors that simply mechanically align optical fibres end to
  end in a digital line system. They perform no other function, such as the amplification,
  regeneration or modification of a signal.\r\n* 8\\. Heading 8537 does not include
  cordless infrared devices for the remote control of television receivers or other
  electrical equipment (heading 8543).\r\n* 9\\. For the purpose of headings 8541
  and 8542:\r\n  * (a) 'Diodes, transistors and similar semiconductor devices' are
  semiconductor devices the operation of which depends on variations in resistivity
  on the application of an electric field.\r\n  * (b) 'Electronic integrated circuits'
  are:\r\n    * (1) monolithic integrated circuits in which the circuit elements (diodes,
  transistors, resistors, capacitors, inductances, etc.) are created in the mass (essentially)
  and on the surface of a semiconductor or compound semiconductor material (for example
  doped silicon, gallium arsenide, silicon germanium, lndium phosphide) and are inseparably
  associated;\r\n    * (2) hybrid integrated circuits in which passive elements (resistors,
  capacitors, inductances, etc), obtained by thin-or thick-film technology, and active
  elements (diodes, transistors, monolithic integrated circuits, etc.), obtained by
  semiconductor technology, are combined to all intents and purposes indivisibly,
  by interconnections or inter connecting cables, on a single insulating substrate
  (glass, ceramic, etc.). These circuits may also include discrete components;\r\n
  \   * (3) multichip integrated circuits consisting of two or more interconnected
  monolithic integrated circuits combined to all intents and purposes indivisibly,
  whether or not on one or more insulating substrates, with or without leadframes,
  but with no other active or passive circuit elements.\r\n    * (4)  multi-component
  integrated circuits (MCOs): a combination of one or more monolithic, hybrid, or
  multi-chip integrated circuits with at least one of the following components: silicon-based
  sensors, actuators, oscillators, resonators or combinations thereof, or components
  performing the functions of articles classifiable under heading 8532, 8533, 8541,
  or inductors classifiable under heading 8504, formed to all intents and purposes
  indivisibly into a single body like an integrated circuit, as a component of a kind
  used for assembly onto a printed circuit board (PCB) or other carrier, through the
  connecting of pins, leads, balls, lands, bumps, or pads.\r\nFor the purpose of this
  definition:\r\n\r\n       (1) Components may be discrete, manufactured independently
  then assembled onto the rest of the MCO, or integrated into other components.\r\n\r\n

  based sensors consist of microelectronic or mechanical structures that are created
  in the mass or on the surface of a semiconductor and that have the function of detecting
  physical or chemical quantities and transducing these into electric signals, caused
  by resulting variations in electric properties or displacement of a mechanical structure.
  Physical or chemical quantities relates to real world phenomena, such as pressure,
  acoustic waves, acceleration, vibration, movement, orientation, strain, magnetic
  field strength, electric field strength, light, radioactivity, humidity, flow, chemicals
  concentration, etc.\r\n            (b)'Silicon based actuators consist of microelectronic

  depends on the physical geometry of these structures.\r\n\r\n* For the classification
  of the articles defined in this note, headings 8541 and 8542 shall take precedence
  over any other heading in the nomenclature, except in the case of heading 8523,
  which might cover them by reference to, in particular, their function.\r\n* 10\\.
  For the purposes of heading 8548, 'spent primary cells, spent primary batteries
  and spent electric accumulators' are those which are neither usable as such because
  of breakage, cutting-up, wear or other reasons, nor capable of being recharged.\r\n\r\n##
  Subheading notes ##\r\n\r\n* 1\\. Subheading 8527 12 covers only cassette-players
  with built-in amplifier, without built-in loudspeaker, capable of operating without
  an external source of electric power and the dimensions of which do not exceed 170
  mm x 100 mm x 45 mm.\r\n\r\n## Additional notes ##\r\n\r\n* 1\\. Subheadings 8519

  8528 71 91 only, the term 'modem' covers devices or equipment that modulate and
  demodulate incoming and outgoing signals, such as V.90-modems or cable modems, and
  other devices that use like technologies for gaining access to the internet, such
  as VLAN, ISDN and ethernet. The extent of access to the internet may be limited
  by the service provider.\r\n* Apparatus of these subheadings must enable a two-way
  communication process or the two-way flow of information for the purposes of providing
  interactive information exchange."
