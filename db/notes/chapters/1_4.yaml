:content: "1 The expression milk means full-cream milk or partially or completely
  skimmed milk. \r\n\r\n2 For the purposes of heading 0405:  \r\n(a) the term butter
  means natural butter, whey butter or recombined butter (fresh, salted or rancid,
  including canned butter) derived exclusively from milk, with a milkfat content of
  80 % or more but not more than 95 % by weight, a maximum milk solids-not-fat content
  of 2 % by weight and a maximum water content of 16 % by weight. Butter does not
  contain added emulsifiers, but may contain sodium chloride, food colours, neutralising
  salts and cultures of harmless lactic-acid-producing bacteria; \r\n\r\n(b) the expression
  dairy spreads means a spreadable emulsion of the water-in-oil type, containing milkfat
  as the only fat in the product, with a milkfat content of 39 % or more but less
  than 80 % by weight.\r\n\r\n3 Products obtained by the concentration of whey and
  with the addition of milk or milkfat are to be classified as cheese in heading 0406
  provided that they have the three following characteristics:\r\n\r\n(a) a milkfat
  content, by weight of the dry matter, of 5 % or more;\r\n\r\n(b) a dry matter content,
  by weight, of at least 70 % but not exceeding 85 %; and\r\n\r\n(c) they are moulded
  or capable of being moulded.\r\n\r\n4 This chapter does not cover:\r\n\r\n(a) products
  obtained from whey, containing by weight more than 95 % lactose, expressed as anhydrous
  lactose calculated on the dry matter (heading 1702);\r\n\r\n(b) products obtained
  from milk by replacing one or more of its natural constituents (for example, butyric
  fats) by another substance (for example, oleic fats) (heading 1901 or 2106); or\r\n\r\n(c)
  albumins (including concentrates of two or more whey proteins, containing by weight
  more than 80 % whey proteins, calculated on the dry matter) (heading 3502) or globulins
  (heading 3504).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Subheading notes ##\r\n\r\n*1 For the purposes of
  subheading 0404 10, the expression modified whey means products consisting of whey
  constituents, that is, whey from which all or part of the lactose, proteins or minerals
  have been removed, whey to which natural whey constituents have been added, and
  products obtained by mixing natural whey constituents.\r\n\r\n*2. For the purposes
  of subheading 0405 10, the term butter does not include dehydrated butter or ghee
  (subheading 0405 90).\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes##\r\n\r\n*1 The duty rate applicable
  to mixtures falling in headings 0401 to 0406 shall be as follows:\r\n\r\n(a) in
  mixtures where one of the components represents at least 90 % by weight, the rate
  applicable to that component applies;\r\n\r\n(b) in other mixtures, the rate applicable
  shall be that of the component which results in the highest amount of import duty.\r\n\r\n*2
  For the purposes of subheadings 0408 11 and 0408 19, the following applies:\r\n\r\nthe
  expression otherwise preserved applies also to egg yolks with limited amounts of
  salt (in general, an amount of up to around 12 % by weight) or minor amounts of
  chemicals added for preservation purposes, provided that both of the following conditions
  are fulfilled:\r\n\r\n(i) the products retain the character of egg yolks of subheadings
  0408 11 and 0408 19;\r\n\r\n(ii) salt or chemicals are not used at a level higher
  than is necessary for the purposes of preservation.\r\n\r\n*3 Dairy produce of Chapter
  4 includes dairy permeates, which are milk products characterised by a high content
  of lactose and obtained by removing milk fats and milk proteins from milk, whey,
  cream and/or sweet buttermilk, and/or from similar raw material by ultrafiltration
  or other processing techniques.\r\n\r\n*4 For the purposes of subheadings 0404 10
  and 0404 90 the following applies:\r\n\r\nMilk permeate and whey permeate can be
  analytically distinguished by the presence of substances (e.g. lactic acid, lactates
  and glycomacropeptides) which are associated with whey production.\r\n\r\nSubheading
  0404 10 includes whey permeate which is a product with generally a slightly sour
  smell, obtained from whey or mixtures of natural whey constituents by ultrafiltration
  or other processing techniques.\r\n\r\nThe presence of substances associated with
  whey production (e.g. lactic acid, lactates and glycomacropeptides) is a condition
  for the classification of whey permeates into that subheading.\r\n\r\nSubheading
  0404 90 includes milk permeate which is a product with generally a milky smell obtained
  from milk by ultrafiltration or other processing techniques. The quantitatively
  limited level or absence of lactic acid and lactates (max. 0,1 % by weight, in milk
  permeates in powder form, or max. 0,015 % by weight in milk permeates in liquid
  form) as well as the absence of glycomacropeptides, are the conditions for the classification
  of milk permeates into subheading 0404 90.\r\n\r\nThe method to be used for the
  detection of lactates shall be the ISO 8069:2005 method and the method to detect
  rennet whey (i.e. the presence of caseinomacropeptides such as glycomacropeptides)
  shall be the method set out in Annex XII to Commission Regulation (EC) No 273/2008
  (1)."
