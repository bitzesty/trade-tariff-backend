  and 2009 71, the expression 'Brix value' means the direct reading of degrees Brix
  obtained from a Brix hydrometer or of refractive index expressed in terms of percentage
  sucrose content obtained from a refractometer, at a temperature of 20C or corrected
  for 20C if the reading is made at a different temperature.\r\n\r\n## Additional
  notes ##\r\n\r\n* 1\\. For the purposes of heading 2001, vegetables, fruit, nuts
  and other edible parts of plants prepared or preserved by vinegar or acetic acid
  must have a content of free, volatile acid of 0.5% by weight or more, expressed

  salt content exceeding 2.5% by weight.\r\n* 2\\. (a) The content of various sugars
  expressed as sucrose (sugar content) of the products classified in this chapter
  corresponds to the figure indicated by a refractometer at a temperature of 20C and
  multiplied by the factor:\r\n  * - 0.93 in respect of products of subheadings 2008
  20 to 2008 80, 2008 93, 2008 97 and 2008 99, or\r\n  * - 0.95 in respect of products
  of the other headings.\r\n  * (b) The expression 'Brix value', mentioned in the
  subheadings of heading 2009, corresponds to the figure indicated by a refractometer
  at a temperature of 20C.\r\n* 3\\. The products of subheadings 2008 20, to 2008
  80, 2008 93, 2008 97 and 2008 99 are to be considered as containing added sugar
  when the 'sugar content' thereof exceeds by weight the percentages given hereunder,
  according to the kind of fruit or edible part of plant concerned:\r\n * - pineapples
  and grapes: 13%,\r\n * - other fruits, including mixtures of fruit, and other edible
  parts of plants: 9%.\r\n* 4\\. For the purposes of subheadings 2008 30 11 to 2008

  have the meanings hereby assigned to them:\r\n * - 'actual alcoholic strength by
  mass': the number of kilograms of pure alcohol contained in 100 kg of the product;\r\n
  \ * - '% mas': the symbol for alcoholic strength by mass.\r\n* 5\\. The following
  is to be applied to the products as they are presented:\r\n  * (a) The added sugar

  sugar of a Brix value not exceeding 67 and containing less than 50% by weight of
  fruit juice lose their original character of fruit juices of heading 2009. Item
  (b) does not apply to concentrated natural fruit juices. Consequently, concentrated
  natural fruit juices are not excluded from heading 2009.\r\n* 6\\. For the purposes
  of subheadings 2009 69 51 and 2009 69 71, 'concentrated grape juice (including grape
