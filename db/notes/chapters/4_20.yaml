  prepared or preserved by the processes specified in Chapter 7, 8 or 11;\r\n\r\n(b)
  food preparations containing more than 20 % by weight of sausage, meat, meat offal,
  blood, fish or crustaceans, molluscs or other aquatic invertebrates, or any combination
  thereof (Chapter 16); \r\n\r\n(c) bakers' wares and other products of heading 1905;
  or\r\n\r\n(d) homogenised composite food preparations of heading 2104.\r\n\r\n2
  Headings 2007 and 2008 do not apply to fruit jellies, fruit pastes, sugar-coated
  almonds or the like in the form of sugar confectionery (heading 1704) or chocolate
  confectionery (heading 1806).\r\n\r\n3 Headings 2001, 2004 and 2005 cover, as the
  case may be, only those products of Chapter 7 or of heading 1105 or 1106 (other
  than flour, meal and powder of the products of Chapter 8) which have been prepared
  or preserved by processes other than those referred to in note 1(a).\r\n\r\n4 Tomato
  juice, the dry weight content of which is 7 % or more, is to be classified in heading
  2002.\r\n\r\n5 For the purposes of heading 2007, the expression obtained by cooking
  means obtained by heat treatment at atmospheric pressure or under reduced pressure
  to increase the viscosity of a product through reduction of water content or other
  means.\r\n\r\n6 For the purposes of heading 2009, the expression juices, unfermented
  and not containing added spirit means juices of an alcoholic strength by volume
  (see note 2 to Chapter 22) not exceeding 0,5 % vol.\r\n\r\n## Subheading notes ##\r\n\r\n1.For
  the purposes of subheading 2005 10, the expression homogenised vegetables means
  preparations of vegetables, finely homogenised, put up for retail sale as food suitable
  for infants or young children or for dietetic purposes, in containers of a net weight
  content not exceeding 250 g. For the application of this definition, no account
  is to be taken of small quantities of any ingredients which may have been added
  to the preparation for seasoning, preservation or other purposes. These preparations
  may contain a small quantity of visible pieces of vegetables. Subheading 2005 10
  takes precedence over all other subheadings of heading 2005.\r\n\r\n2.For the purposes
  of subheading 2007 10, the expression homogenised preparations means preparations
  of fruit, finely homogenised, put up for retail sale as food suitable for infants
  or young children or for dietetic purposes, in containers of a net weight content
  not exceeding 250 g. For the application of this definition, no account is to be
  taken of small quantities of any ingredients which may have been added to the preparation
  for seasoning, preservation or other purposes. These preparations may contain a
  small quantity of visible pieces of fruit. Subheading 2007 10 takes precedence over
  all other subheadings of heading 2007.\r\n\r\n3.For the purposes of subheadings
  2009 12, 2009 21, 2009 31, 2009 41, 2009 61 and 2009 71, the expression Brix value
  means the direct reading of degrees Brix obtained from a Brix hydrometer or of refractive
  index expressed in terms of percentage sucrose content obtained from a refractometer,
  at a temperature of 20 C or corrected for 20 C if the reading is made at a different
  temperature.\r\n\r\n## Additional notes ##\r\n\r\n1 For the purposes of heading
  2001, vegetables, fruit, nuts and other edible parts of plants prepared or preserved
  by vinegar or acetic acid must have a content of free, volatile acid of 0,5 % by
  weight or more, expressed as acetic acid. In addition, mushrooms of subheading 2001
  90 50 should not have a salt content exceeding 2,5 % by weight.\r\n\r\n2 (a) The
  content of various sugars expressed as sucrose (sugar content) of products classified
  in this Chapter corresponds to the figure indicated by a refractometer (used in
  accordance with the method prescribed in the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU)
  No 974/2014 (1)) at a temperature of 20 C and multiplied by one of the following
  factors:\r\n\r\n  0,93 in respect of products of subheadings 2008 20 to 2008 80,
  2008 93, 2008 97 and 2008 99;\r\n\r\n 0,95 in respect of products of the other headings.\r\n\r\nHowever,
  the content of various sugars expressed as sucrose (sugar content) of the following
  products classified in this Chapter:\r\n\r\n products manufactured on the basis
  of seaweed and other algae prepared or preserved by processes not provided for in
  Chapter 12;\r\n\r\n products manufactured on the basis of manioc, arrowroot, salep,
  Jerusalem artichokes, sweet potatoes and similar roots and tubers with high starch
  or inulin content of heading 0714;\r\n\r\n products manufactured on the basis of
  vine leaves;\r\n\r\ncorresponds to the figure resulting from a calculation carried
  out on the basis of measurements which have been obtained applying the high performance
  liquid chromatography method (the HPLC method), using the following formula:\r\n\r\nS
  + (G + F)  0,95;\r\n\r\nwhere:\r\n\r\nS is the sucrose content determined by the
  HPLC method;\r\nF is the fructose content determined by the HPLC method;\r\nG is
  the glucose content determined by the HPLC method.\r\n\r\n(b) The expression Brix
  value, mentioned in the subheadings of heading 2009, corresponds to the figure indicated
  by a refractometer (used in accordance with the method prescribed in the Annex to
  Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 974/2014 (1)) at a temperature of 20
  C.\r\n\r\n3 The products of subheadings 2008 20 to 2008 80, 2008 93, 2008 97 and
  2008 99 are to be considered as containing added sugar when the sugar content thereof
  exceeds by weight the percentages given hereunder, according to the kind of fruit
  or edible part of plant concerned:\r\n\r\n pineapples and grapes: 13 %,\r\n\r\n
  other fruits, including mixtures of fruit, and other edible parts of plants: 9 %.\r\n\r\n4

  2008 99 11 to 2008 99 40, the following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned
  to them:\r\n\r\n actual alcoholic strength by mass: the number of kilograms of pure
  alcohol contained in 100 kg of the product,\r\n\r\n % mas: the symbol for alcoholic
  strength by mass.\r\n\r\n5 The following is to be applied to the products as they
  are presented:\r\n\r\n(a) the added sugar content of products of heading 2009 corresponds
  to the sugar content less the figures given hereunder, according to the kind of
  juice concerned:\r\n\r\n  lemon or tomato juice: 3,\r\n\r\n grape juice: 15,\r\n\r\n
  other fruit or vegetable juices, including mixtures of juices: 13.\r\n\r\n(b) the
  fruit juices with added sugar, of a Brix value not exceeding 67 and containing less
  than 50 % by weight of fruit juice lose their original character of fruit juices
  of heading 2009.\r\nItem (b) does not apply to concentrated natural fruit juices.
  Consequently, concentrated natural fruit juices are not excluded from heading 2009.\r\n\r\n6
  For the purposes of subheadings 2009 69 51 and 2009 69 71, concentrated grape juice
  (including grape must) means grape juice (including grape must) for which the figure
