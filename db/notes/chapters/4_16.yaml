:section: 4
:chapter: 16
:content: "* 1\\. This chapter does not cover meat, meat offal, fish, crustaceans,
  molluscs or other aquatic invertebrates, prepared or preserved by the processes
  specified in Chapter 2 or 3 or heading 0504.\r\n* 2\\. Food preparations fall in
  this chapter provided that they contain more than 20% by weight of sausage, meat,
  meat offal, blood, fish or crustaceans, molluscs or other aquatic invertebrates,
  or any combination thereof. In cases where the preparation contains two or more
  of the products mentioned above, it is classified within the heading of Chapter
  16 corresponding to the component or components which predominate by weight. These
  provisions do not apply to the stuffed products of heading 1902 or to the preparations
  of heading 2103 or 2104.\r\nFor preparations containing liver, the provisions of
  the second sentence shall not apply in determining the subheadings within heading
  1601 or 1602.\r\n\r\n## Subheading notes ##\r\n\r\n* 1\\. For the purposes of subheading
  1602 10, the expression homogenised preparations means preparations of meat, meat
  offal or blood, finely homogenised, put up for retail sale as food suitable for
  infants or young children or for dietetic purposes, in containers of a net weight
  content not exceeding 250 g. For the application of this definition, no account
  is to be taken of small quantities of any ingredients which may have been added
  to the preparation for seasoning, preservation or other purposes. These preparations
  may contain a small quantity of visible pieces of meat or meat offal. This subheading
  takes precedence over all other subheadings of heading 1602.\r\n* 2\\. The fish,
  crustaceans, molluscs and other aquatic invertebrates specified in the subheadings
  of heading 1604 or 1605 under their common names only, are of the same species as
  those mentioned in Chapter 3 under the same name\r\n\r\n   ## Additional notes ##\r\n\r\n*
  1\\. For the purposes of subheadings 1602 31 11, 1602 32 11, 1602 39 21, 1602 50
  10 and 1602 90 61, the term uncooked is to apply to products which have not been
  subjected to any heat treatment or which have been subjected to a heat treatment
  insufficient to ensure the coagulation of meat proteins in the whole of the product
  and which, therefore, in the case of subheadings 1602 50 10 and 1602 90 61, show
  traces of a pinkish liquid on the cut surface when the product is cut along a line
  passing through its thickest part.\r\n\r\n* 2\\. For the purposes of subheadings
  1602 41 10, 1602 42 10 and 1602 49 11 to 1602 49 15, the expression cuts thereof
  applies only to prepared or preserved meat which, due to the size and the characteristics
  of the coherent muscle tissue, is identifiable as having been obtained from hams,
  shoulders, loins, or collars of domestic swine, as the case may be."
