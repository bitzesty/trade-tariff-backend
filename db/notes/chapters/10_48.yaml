  where the terms of the headings otherwise require, paper, paperboard, cellulose
  wadding and webs of cellulose fibres answering to a description in two or more of
  the headings 4801 to 4811 are to be classified under that one of such headings which
  occurs last in numerical order in the nomenclature.\r\n* 8\\. Headings 4801 and
  4803 to 4809 apply only to paper, paperboard, cellulose wadding and webs of cellulose

  on a base of paper or paperboard, suitable for use both as floor coverings and as
  wall coverings are to be classified in heading 4823.\r\n* 10\\. Heading 4820 does
  not cover loose sheets or cards, cut to size, whether or not printed, embossed or
  perforated.\r\n* 11\\. Heading 4823 applies, inter alia, to perforated paper or
  paperboard cards for jacquard or similar machines and paper lace.\r\n* 12\\. Except
  for the goods of headings 4814 or 4821, paper, paperboard, cellulose wadding and
  articles thereof, printed with motifs, characters or pictorial representations,
  which are not merely incidental to the primary use of the goods, fall in Chapter
  49.\r\n\r\n## Subheading notes ##\r\n\r\n* 1\\. For the purposes of subheadings
