:content: "* 1\\. This chapter does not cover:\r\n  * (a) pig fat or poultry fat of
  heading 0209;\r\n  * (b) cocoa butter, fat and oil (heading 1804);\r\n  * (c) edible
  preparations containing by weight more than 15% of the products of heading 0405
  (generally Chapter 21);\r\n  * (d) greaves (heading 2301) and residues of headings
  2304 to 2306;\r\n  * (e) fatty acids, prepared waxes, medicaments, paints, varnishes,
  soap, perfumery, cosmetic or toilet preparations, sulphonated oils or other goods

  Heading 1509 does not apply to oils obtained from olives by solvent extraction (heading
  1510).\r\n* 3\\. Heading 1518 does not cover fats or oils or their fractions merely
  denatured, which are to be classified in the heading appropriate to the corresponding
  undenatured fats and oils and their fractions.\r\n* 4\\. Soap-stocks, oil foots
  and dregs, stearin pitch, glycerol pitch and wool grease residues fall in heading
  1522.\r\n\r\n## Subheading note ##\r\n\r\n* 1\\. For the purposes of subheadings
  1514 11 and 1514 19, the expression 'low-erucic-acid rape or colza oil' means the
  fixed oil which has an erucic acid content of less than 2% by weight.\r\n\r\n##

  by pressure, are to be considered as 'crude' if they have undergone no other processing
  than:\r\n    * - decantation within the normal time limits;\r\n    * - centrifugation
  or filtration, provided that, in order to separate the oils from their solid constituents,
  only mechanical force, such as gravity, pressure or centrifugal force, has been
  employed (excluding any adsorption filtering process or any other physical or chemical
  process);\r\n  * (b) fixed vegetable oils, fluid or solid, obtained by extraction
  are to continue to be considered as 'crude' when they cannot be distinguished, by
  their colour, odour or taste, nor by recognised special analytical properties, from
  vegetable oils and fats obtained by pressure;\r\n  * (c) the expression 'crude oils'
  are to be taken to extend to degummed soya-bean oil and to cotton-seed oil from
  which the gossypol has been removed.\r\n* 2\\. (A). Headings 1509 and 1510 cover

  re-esterified olive oil) and mixtures of olive oil with other oils. The presence
  of re-esterified olive oil or other oils is ascertained using the methods set out

  10 covers only the olive oils defined in points I and II below, obtained solely
  by mechanical or other physical means under conditions which do not lead to the
  modification of the oil, and which have not undergone any treatment other than washing,
  decantation, centrifugation or filtration. Olive oils obtained using solvents, chemical
  or biochemical reagents, or re-esterification processes, as well as any mixtures
  with oils of other kinds, are excluded from this subheading.\r\n  * I. For the purposes
  of subheading 1509 10 10, 'lampante olive oil' whatever its acidity, means olive

  areas.\r\n* 4\\. The analytical methods for the determination of the characteristics
  of the products referred to above are those laid down in the Annexes to Commission
  Regulation (EEC) No 2568/91. Accordingly, account is to be taken also of the footnotes
  of Annex I to the Regulation.\r\n* 5\\. Food preparations made from products of
  Chapter 15 presented in measured doses, such as capsules, tablets, pastilles and
  pills, intended for use as food supplements, are excluded from this Chapter.  The
  essential character of a food supplement is not only given by its ingredients, but
  also by its specific form or presentation revealing its function as a food supplement,
  since it determines the dosage, the way in which it is absorbed and the place where
  it is supposed to become active.  Such food preparations are to be classified under
  heading 2106 insofar as they are not specified or included elsewhere.\r\n"
