:content: "* 1\\. This chapter does not cover:\r\n  * (a) separate chemically defined
  organic compounds, other than pure methane and propane which are to be classified
  in heading 2711;\r\n  * (b) medicaments of heading 3003 or 3004; or\r\n  * (c) mixed
  unsaturated hydrocarbons of heading 3301, 3302 or 3805.\r\n* 2\\. References in
  heading 2710 to 'petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals' include
  not only petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals but also similar
  oils, as well as those consisting mainly of mixed unsaturated hydrocarbons, obtained
  by any process, provided that the weight of the non-aromatic constituents exceeds
  that of the aromatic constituents. However, the references do not include liquid
  synthetic polyolefins of which less than 60% by volume distils at 300 C, after conversion
  to 1,013 millibars when a reduced-pressure distillation method is used (Chapter
  39).\r\n* 3\\. For the purposes of heading 2710, 'waste oils' means waste containing
  mainly petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals (as described in
  note 2 to this chapter), whether or not mixed with water. These include:\r\n  *
  (a) such oils no longer fit for use as primary products (for example, used lubricating
  oils, used hydraulic oils and used transformer oils);\r\n  * (b) sludge oils from
  the storage tanks of petroleum oils, mainly containing such oils and a high concentration
  of additives (for example, chemicals) used in the manufacture of the primary products;
  and\r\n  * (c) such oils in the form of emulsions in water or mixtures with water,
  such as those resulting from oil spills, storage tank washings, or from the use
  of cutting oils for machining operations.\r\n\r\n## Subheading notes ##\r\n\r\n*

  term 'viscosity V' means the 'kinematic viscosity' at 50 C expressed in 10-6 m2
  s-1 by the EN ISO 3104 method.\r\n* The term diluted colour C means the colour of
  a product, as determined by the ISO 2049 method (equivalent to the ASTM D 1 500
  method),\r\nafter one part of the product has been made up to 100 parts by volume
  with xylene, toluene or another suitable solvent. The colour must be\r\ndetermined
  immediately after dilution.\r\n* Subheading 2710 19 51 to 2710 19 68 and 2710 2031
  to 2710 2039 cover only fuel oils of natural colour.\r\n* These subheadings do not
  cover heavy oils defined in paragraph (d) above for which it is not possible to
  determine:\r\n  * - the distillation percentage at 250 C by the EN ISO 3104 method
  (zero shall be deemed to be a percentage);\r\n  * - the kinematic viscosity at 50
  C by the EN ISO 3104 method;\r\n  * - or the diluted colour C by the ASTM D 1500
  method.\r\n* Such products fall in subheadings 2710 19 71 to 2710 19 99.\r\n  *
  (g) 'containing biodiesel' means that the products of subheading 2710 20 have a
  minimum content of biodiesel, i.e. mono-alkyl esters of fatty acids (FAMAE) of a
  kind used as a fuel, of 0.5% by volume (determination by the EN 14078 method).\r\n*
  3\\. For the purposes of heading 2712 the expression 'crude petroleum jelly' (subheading
  2712 10 10) is to be taken to apply to petroleum jelly of a natural colour higher
  than 4.5 by the ASTM D 1500 method.\r\n* 4\\. For the purposes of subheadings 2712
  90 31 to 2712 90 39, the term 'crude' is to be taken to apply to products:\r\n  *
  (a) with an oil content of 3.5 or higher by the ISO 2908 method, if their viscosity
  at 100 C is lower than \r\n9x10-6 m2 s-1 by the EN ISO 3104 method; or\r\n  * (b)
  of a natural colour higher than 3 by the ASTM D 1500 method, if their viscosity
  at 100 C is \r\n9x10-6 m2 s-1 or higher by the EN ISO 3104 method.\r\n* 5\\. For
  the purposes of headings 2710, 2711 and 2712, the term 'specific process' is to

  isomerisation;\r\n  * (k) (in respect of products of subheadings 2710 19 31 to 2710
  19 99 only) desulphurisation with hydrogen resulting in a reduction of at least
  85% of the sulphur content of the products processed (EN ISO 20846, EN ISO 20884,
  or EN ISO 14596 or EN ISO 24260, EN ISO 20847 and EN ISO 8754 method);\r\n  * (l)
  (in respect of products of heading 2710 only) deparaffing by a process other than
  filtering;\r\n  * (m) (in respect of products of subheadings 2710 19 31 to 2710
  19 99 only) treatment with hydrogen at a pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature
  of more than 250 C with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurisation,
  when the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction. The further
  treatment with hydrogen of lubricating oils of subheadings 2710 19 71 to 2710 19
  99 (eg hydrofinishing or decolourisation) in order, more especially, to improve
  colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;\r\n
  \ * (n) (in respect of products of subheadings 2710 19 51 to 2710 19 68 only) atmospheric
  distillation, on condition that less than 30% of these products distils, by volume,
  including losses, at 300 C by the ISO 3405 method (equivalent to the ASTM D 86 method).
  If 30% or more by volume, including losses, of such products distils at 300 C by
  the ISO 3405 method (equivalent to the ASTM D 86 method), the quantities of products
  which may be obtained during the atmospheric distillation and which fall in subheadings
  2710 12 11 to 2710 12 90 or 2710 19 11 to 2710 19 29 shall be dutiable at the same
  rates as those provided for under subheadings 2710 19 62 to 2710 19 68 according
  to the kind and value of the products used and on the net weight of the products
  obtained. This rule shall not apply to products so obtained which, within a period
  of six months and subject to such other conditions as may be determined by the competent
  authorities, are to undergo a specific process or chemical transformation by a process
  not being a specific process;\r\n  * (o) (in respect of products of subheadings
  2710 19 71 to 2710 19 99 only) treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical
  brush-discharge;\r\n  * (p) solely for products under subheading 2712 9031: de-oiling
  by fractional crystallisation.\r\n* Should any preparatory treatment prior to the
  above treatments be necessary by reason of technical requirements, the customs exemption
  is to apply only to the quantities of the products intended for and actually subjected
  to such of the above treatments; any waste products arising during preparatory treatment
  are also to be exempt from customs duty.\r\n* 6\\. The quantities of products which
  may be obtained during chemical transformation, or during preparatory treatment
  which may be necessary by reason of technical requirements, and which fall in headings
  or subheadings 2707 10 10, 2707 20 10, 2707 30 10, 2707 50 10, 2710, 2711, 2712
  10, 2712 20, 2712 90 31 to 2712 90 99 and 2713 90, are to be dutiable at the same
  rates as those provided for in respect of products 'for other purposes', according
  to the kind and value of the products used and on the net weight of the products
  obtained. This rule shall not apply to such products of headings 2710 to 2712 which,
  within a period of six months and subject to such other conditions as may be determined
  by the competent authorities, are to undergo a specific process or further chemical
  transformation.\r\n\r\n- - - \r\n\r\n Unless otherwise stated the term 'method'
  means the latest version of the determination methods laid down by the Comit Europen
  de Normlisation (CEN), the International Standardisation Organisation (ISO) or the
  American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM).\r\n\r\n(1) This does not apply
  to Fuel oils, of subheadings, 2710 20 31 to 2710 20 39, which contain fatty-acid
  methylesters (FAME) and which have a saponification index exceeding 4."
