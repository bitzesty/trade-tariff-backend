  articles that are broadly recognised as traditionally used at Christmas festivities
  and exclusively manufactured and designed as articles for\r\nChristmas festivities.\r\nThese
  are:\r\n*(1) articles associated with the nativity (i.e. articles for the traditional
  Christmas crib), such as nativity figures, nativity animals, Bethlehem\r\nstars,
  the three nativity kings, and nativity scenes;\r\n*(2) articles recognized as being
  used at Christmas festivities due to long standing national traditions, such as:\r\n
  artificial Christmas trees,\r\n Christmas stockings,\r\n imitation yule logs,\r\n
  Christmas crackers,\r\n Father Christmases with or without a sledge,\r\n Christmas
  angels.\r\nThe subheading does not cover articles of the winter season which are
  suitable for a more general use as decorations during that season, because\r\ntheir
  objective characteristics suggest that they are not exclusively used for Christmas
  festivities but mainly as decorations during the winter\r\nseason, such as icicles,
  snow- crystals, stars, reindeers, robins, snowmen, and other images of the winter
  season, whether or not the colours or\r\noutfits etc. suggest a connection with
  Christmas.\r\n*(b) decorative articles for Christmas trees.\r\nThese are articles
  designed to be hung on a Christmas tree (i.e. lightweight articles of generally
  non-durable material designed to decorate\r\na Christmas tree). The articles must
  have a connection with Christmas."
